He is co-editor of the book `` Deadline Artists : America 's Greatest Newspaper Columns . '' ( CNN ) -- Beneath Rick Santorum 's stunning three-state sweep on Tuesday stands another stubborn sign of dissatisfaction with the status quo : Republican turnout is down . I 'm talking embarrassingly , disturbingly , hey-don't-you-know-it's-an-election-year bad . It is a sign of a serious enthusiasm gap among the rank and file , and a particularly bad omen for Mitt Romney and the GOP in the general election . Here 's the tale of the tape , state by state , beginning with Tuesday night : Minnesota had just more than 47,000 people turn out for its caucuses this year -- four years ago it was nearly 63,000 -- and Romney came in first , not a distant third as he did Tuesday night . In Colorado , more than 70,000 people turned out for its caucus in 2008 -- but in 2012 it was 65,000 . And Missouri -- even making a generous discount for the fact that this was an entirely symbolic contest -- had 232,000 people turn out , less than half the number who did four years ago . Even with months of pre-primary hype and attention solely devoted to the Republican field , turnout in this election cycle essentially flat-lined . In Iowa , a little more than 121,000 people voted , compared with nearly 119,000 four years before , when action in the Democratic caucuses absorbed most of the attention . In New Hampshire , the same dynamic applied -- 245,000 voters turned out in 2012 , compared with 241,000 four years before , despite Republicans being the only game in town and independents making up 47 % of the total turnout in 2012 , according to CNN exit polls . Take out the independent voters and you 've got a deep net decline . Always proudly rebellious , South Carolina has been the great outlier in this election cycle . With Newt Gingrich making an all-out push for conservatives in a conservative state , turnout was up almost 150,000 over four years before . But in Florida , the decline became unmistakable . Maybe it decreased because the Romney and Gingrich campaigns , plus super PACS , spent more than $ 18 million in the Sunshine State on TV ads , of which 93 % were negative in the last week alone , according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group . After all , negative ads depress turnout . But after all the mud was thrown , 1.6 million people turned out in the nation 's fourth largest state , which might sound impressive until you compare it with the nearly 2 million who turned out in 2008 . Nevada was even worse , with 32,894 people turning out to vote in a state with more than 465,000 registered Republicans . Four years before , more than 44,300 participated in the caucus . Turnout was down more than 25 % despite the GOP caucuses being the only game in town . Party officials were expecting a turnout of more than 70,000 . All this should be a wake-up call for the GOP . Despite an enormous amount of national media attention devoted to each of the states to date , the response has been a notable yawn among the Republican rank and file . The turnout numbers are even worse when you compare them with the number of registered Republicans in each state that has voted to date . The caucuses in particular bring out an unrepresentative sample of a state 's Republican Party . For all the grass-roots romanticism , there has got to be a better way to pick a presidential nominee . But the news is worst for Romney , long the presumptive front-runner in a party that tends to reward the man next in line . `` Reluctantly Romney '' could be a bumper sticker , even for his supporters . The former Massachusetts governor has found it difficult to climb above 35 % in national polls , meaning that a majority of Republicans still support someone else in a notably weak field . His vote margins and totals lag behind those of four years before , when he lost the nomination to John McCain in a crowded and comparatively competent field , although Minnesota is the first state he won in '08 and lost in 2012 . You reap what you sow , and part of the reason turnout is down is directly related to the problem of polarization . The Republican Party is more ideologically polarized than at any time in recent history . Therefore , it put up more purely right-wing candidates than it did four years before , when center-right leaders such as McCain and Rudy Giuliani were also in the race . A bigger tent inspired bigger turnout . But the other reason is simple dissatisfaction with the candidates . Republicans seem united in their anger against the president -- like the Democrats in 2004 -- but they are uninspired by their options . Draft movements for fantasy candidates ranging from Chris Christie to Mitch Daniels to Paul Ryan and even Jeb Bush have started and failed . Some party leaders show more enthusiasm for a hypothetical 2016 crop of candidates , including Marco Rubio and Bobby Jindal , than they do for the flawed choices before them in this election .

{"input": "On television nowadays , drinking is the password for anyone desperate for social approval . And there is no better example than the Esquire Network , which began in September and has several tough-sounding new series , including `` Boundless , '' `` Knife Fight '' and `` Brew Dogs , '' that are actually lifestyle shows genteel enough to appeal to the probable targets audience of moneyed metrosexuals . The stars of the Esquire Network are long-distance runners , chefs , beer brewers , fashion gurus and actors , but they all talk about their next drink with relish and swagger : wine , Champagne , craft beer , vodka , scotch , tequila shots , moonshine and even absinthe . It 's not so much thirst that drives the conversation on cable as it is male insecurity . For many channels , but especially for Esquire , which is trying to avoid being dismissed as Lifetime for men , alcohol is the badge of belonging , a liquid demonstration of youthful hipness , New Age machismo , and of being a `` dude '' or a `` bro '' or , as a South African canoe champion says on `` Boundless , '' using the preferred local term , a `` bru '' ( which , as it happens , rhymes with brew ) . A few women are allowed in the club . Aisha Tyler , an actress who is the celebrity tour guide of a recent episode of `` The Getaway , '' chose Paris as her weekend destination because , as she put it , `` I want to eat beautiful food and drink myself silly . '' She does . That kind of barroom boasting is not quite as common on network television anymore ; many of the kinds of shows that once celebrated binge drinking , if only to seem as racy as premium cable , have backed off a bit . A key plotline of the new season of `` Chicago Fire '' ( NBC ) involves the widow of a young fireman who kills her friend in a drunken-driving incident and goes to jail . `` Mom '' is a new CBS comedy about a mother-and-daughter team of former addicts who are in Alcoholics Anonymous .

{"input": "Most people , asked to identify the most universal shift in law enforcement over the past 15 years , would likely think of militarization , calls for community policing , or perhaps the slow decline of `` broken windows '' . But from the turn of the millennium to date , arguably no development has been more widespread in law enforcement than the adoption of so called `` less-lethal '' electric control devices ( ECD ) , which many people know by the name of their most prolific manufacturer : Taser International . The company currently supplies their weapons to 17,800 of the United States ' roughly 18,000 law enforcement agencies . The brand name Taser has become as synonymous with these devices as Kleenex or Xerox have to photocopies and tissues – a quirk of language known as a `` proprietary eponym '' . The word has even become a verb , as people commonly speak of being `` Tased '' or `` Tasered '' . The word Taser , though , did n't start with the company : it 's actually a loose acronym of the book Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle . Jack Cover , the inventor of the modern ECD , named his prototype after the YA sci-fi novel he loved , and the very idea for a less-lethal electric gun was largely inspired by the fictional one described in the book . And while this quirky history is known among some in law enforcement and engineering circles , the innocence with which it 's told – a curious inventor culling inspiration from the literature of his youth – belies a more sinister truth : the book itself is boldly racist . Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle , published in New York in 1911 under the pen name Victor Appleton , is typical of the literature of its time : an imperialist adventure tale set against the backdrop of a wild and dark African continent . In it , the protagonist , Tom Swift , develops an electric rifle – a totally novel idea in 1911 – and decides to test it in Africa in the hunt for ivory . Africa , in the context of the book , exists only as a frontier of underexploited resources ripe for the wealth accumulation of white men daring enough to attempt . `` Elephant shooting in Africa ! My ! With my new electric rifle ... what a fellow could n't do in the dark continent ! '' `` With the price of ivory soaring , '' says Swift 's veteran hunting companion , `` there 's a chance for us all to get a lot of money . '' While this unabashed entrepreneurial imperialism tends to read as a relic of a bygone age , today disproportionately white police departments in places like Ferguson , Missouri , often function similarly as the adventurers sent to do the dangerous work of this kind of wealth generation . Like in the book , black communities are often seen not as dynamic places where people live lives , but as sites for plunder . Take , for example , the Department of Justice 's March report on the prevalence of predatory , revenue-based policing in St Louis County : entire municipalities there , as elsewhere in the US , float their operating budgets and justify their own existence on the racially biased extraction of statutory fees from primarily black residents . This scheme has only begun to decline because of the protests and organizing that defined Ferguson in the wake of Mike Brown 's death . In the book , as in America today , the black people are rendered as either passive , simple and childlike , or animalistic and capable of unimaginable violence . They are described in the book at various points as `` hideous in their savagery , wearing only the loin cloth , and with their kinky hair stuck full of sticks '' , and as `` wild , savage and ferocious ... like little red apes '' . Swift and his travel companions quickly determine the blacks , scarcely human , need to be controlled , guided or killed as determined by the more `` civilized '' white outsiders . Consider then how quickly the black people of Ferguson were rendered something less than fully human in the wake of Mike Brown 's killing : an on-duty Ferguson police officer , a former NYPD commissioner and a popular actor all spared no time in invoking the discourse of `` animals '' in reference to black protesters . Near and far , incredulous commentators sought to cast the police as the sole defenders of black communities , and the only thing standing between those communities and self-destruction . `` White police officers would n't be there if you were n't killing each other , '' former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani said on Meet the Press last November . Echoing Swift 's rank paternalism , he later added : `` I probably saved more black lives as mayor of New York City than any mayor in the history of this city . '' In the book , when Swift and his companions proudly use their advanced weapons – particularly the electric rifle – to dispatch with an incoming buffalo stampede , they too happily celebrate themselves as saviors . `` Had it not been for the white men , the native village , which consisted of only frail huts , would have been completely wiped out by the animals , '' the novel reads . Being named after a racist book does n't make a company or device racist , any more than a person being named after a racist relative makes them so . A name is just that – and a Taser on its face is no more racist than the city or state of Washington are , simply for being named after our slaveholding first president . But as recent campus activism in places such as Harvard and Princeton have demonstrated , there is real value in coming to terms with the bigotry embedded in the seemingly innocuous names and symbols of even our most ordinary , and aspirationally colorblind , institutions . Being aware of the history of the word Taser should make us pause and consider that , every day , predominantly white police officers walk into predominantly black communities armed with weapons first imagined in a book in which `` civilized '' whites entered the black wilds for the purpose of plunder , only to cast themselves as the saviors of the natives .

That 's the bet entrepreneur Adam Bosworth , a veteran of Microsoft MSFT and Google GOOG , is making with Keas , an online service that aims to make exercising and eating your vegetables more fun — or at least a little less painful . San Francisco-based Keas ( pronounced kee-ahs , it is named for a bird found in New Zealand ) sells its web-based app to companies , which in turn push it out to their employees . Co-workers form teams of five or six and enter a competition in which members earn points by answering online quizzes about healthy foods , taking breaks at work to reduce stress , and meeting weekly goals for eating fruits and vegetables , sleeping , and , of course , exercising . All the activities are shared among participants on a Facebook-like news feed , where teammates and rivals can comment , give verbal pats on the back , or urge each other on . Keas charges $ 12 per user for a year and lets companies personalize the site and choose what rewards , if any , they give to winning teams . `` You can change people 's behavior a little , but you have to make it fun for them , '' says Bosworth , who previously ran Google Health , the search giant 's now defunct effort to create online medical records . `` People will fall off the wagon , and that 's when you need a social mechanism to help them climb back on . '' World 's Most Admired Companies : 9 top techs Early results are encouraging . Bechtel , the construction giant , deployed Keas as part of a larger wellness initiative . About 8,000 employees in 44 countries signed up , and roughly half reported losing weight over an initial 12-week period . At Progress Software PRGS , of some 600 employees who signed up , two-thirds reported losing some weight , one-third said they were less stressed , and scores said they pared down unhealthy foods . `` If you are engaged with others and you have a support mechanism , it is going to have a tremendous impact , '' says Joe Andrews , who heads human resources at Progress . But experts warn that while promising , health apps like Keas should be put in perspective . `` You can change behavior for a short time with just about anything , '' says Toni Yancey , professor of public health at UCLA . `` Where the pedal hits the metal is in getting people to change behavior for the long term . '' Despite questions about their overall efficacy , corporate wellness apps are proliferating in part because many investors are betting that the social-gaming wave popularized by Zynga ZNGA can be harnessed to fight obesity . Keas , which has raised $ 17.5 million from investors , competes with Virgin HealthMiles , part of Richard Branson 's Virgin Group , and Red-Brick Health , among others . It seems counterintuitive , but if game-based health companies succeed , they may have couch-potato favorites such as FarmVille and Mafia Wars to thank .

Which big name stars could be on the move this summer ? Find out the latest with Rumor Redux . The Gunners captain declared earlier this week that he would not be renewing his contract with the club - which has just 12 months left to run . Since his announcement a host of clubs have been linked , but Sky Sports understands that just three clubs are currently challenging for his signature - Juventus , Manchester City and Manchester United . All three have been in the reckoning all summer and that has not changed . Both City and United are set to offer him the chance to remain in England , should he leave the Emirates , but Juve are pushing hard with Italian sources claiming their offer would make him one of the highest players in Europe . Van Persie has made it clear that silverware is the most important thing to him at this point - although all three clubs would be well in contention next season to challenge for every honor . The player himself is currently on holiday and is due to return to England next week , when more talks with Arsenal are likely . Paris Saint Germain have been linked , and whilst nobody could deny they could afford Van Persie , Sky Sports understands that the player would not entertain a move to the French capital at this point in his career . And PSG chairman Nasser al-Khelaifi says his club have not made contact with the Dutch forward . `` We have never talked with Van Persie , '' he told l'Equipe . `` We trust our current forwards . But we are trying to find another one .
