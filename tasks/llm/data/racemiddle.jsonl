Researchers found that the more creative the child is, the better he or she is at imagining the pain away.\nThe researchers used a relaxing CD with children. A voice guided them through different fantasy  situations. One of these was pretending to be floating on a cloud. Thirty children took part in the tests. Half of them used the \"guided imagery\" method, and the other half received normal medicines. Researchers found 73.3 percent of the CD users reported a reduction in pain. This compared to only 26.7 percent of kids who got normal treatment.\nStudy leader Dr Miranda Tilburg was very excited about her findings.

Add money for clothes, travel, and other personal expenses, and the cost of one year at a university can be $20, 000 to $30,000 or more.\nStudents need to spend their money carefully. At most universities, advisors can give students advice on how to budget  their money. They suggest this: at the start of a school term, write down your income; for example, money you will get from your family or a part-time job. Then, list all of your expenses. Put your expenses into two groups: those that change (food, phone, books, travel), and those that will stay the same (tuition, room and board). Add together all of your expenses.

Of course, many of us know we may eat the whole thing in the end.\nIt isn't just girls. Most of us find it hard to say 'no' to something attractive, However, scientists now say that willpower is very important to success and a happy life.\nScientists in different countries have been studying the effects of willpower on people's lives for a long time. The results are similar, according to an article on February 7 in the Guardian, a famous British newspaper.\nIn one experiment, scientists told young children that they could either have a marshmallow  now, or two marshmallows in 15 minutes. Waiting obviously needed more willpower. Scientists then continued studying the children as they grew up. They wanted to see if some children always had stronger willpower. They also wanted to see how having stronger willpower affected their lives.\nYears later, scientists found that the children who had waited for two marshmallows were all healthier, happier and richer adults. Oppositely, the children who had shown weaker willpower at that young age were more likely to be in low-paid jobs, to be overweight, to have social problems.\nBut there is hope, Roy F Baumeister, an American social psychology  professor  told the Guardian. Baumeister says we can train our willpower just like we train our muscles.  Even a little practice can strengthen our overall self-control if we do it regularly.\nYou could start by making yourself stand up straight, speaking in complete sentences, or using a computer mouse with the other hand.

Meanwhile, users are expecting faster and faster service.\nGoogle found that if one website is 250 milliseconds slower than another website, then people will visit it less often. This is why technology companies are now competing to be the fastest. Google said people do expect different things from different websites because they realize not all loading times are the same. For example, a person will be more patient waiting for a video to load than for a search result.\nEven so, four out of five online users will click away if a video takes too long to load. This makes it difficult for video websites to choose between the quality of pictures and fast loading times.\nTrying to get a higher speed has always been part of the history of the Internet. In the 1990s, when the World Wide Web first started to become popular, it was very crowded and slow; people called it the \"World Wide Wait\". But engineers managed to fight the problem with new inventions. They laid a lot of fiber optic cables  for sending in high speed; they improved software so it would work more smoothly; they placed computer servers all around the world to be nearer to users; all this increased speed.\nNowadays we can enjoy much faster Internet. Famous search engines such as Google and Microsoft's Bing usually find search results in less than a second. _ .", "question": "What can be the best title of this passage?", "choices": ["Don't make me \"www.wait\".", "Search engines work faster.", "Traffic jams keep us waiting.", "The WWW becomes popular."], "answer": 0, "label": "MUL"}

If you think that you or someone else has broken a bone, the most important things to do are to stay calm, make the hurt person comfortable, and call the doctor. Do not move the injured body part since movement could make it worse.\nTo treat the break, the doctor will need to take an X-ray. This gives the doctor the information he or she needs to set   the bone: to put it back to its normal place. If the bone is large or it is broken in more than one place, the doctor may need to use metal pins   to set it. After the bone has been set, the next step is usually putting on a cast, the special, hard thing that will keep the bone in place for a month or two.\nYour bones are excellent at healing themselves.

Local habits and traditions are not the same as what we knew.\nBut what is ordinary for all British is that they follow traditions.

A century after the accident, scientists have found something new to blame  for the sinking: the moon. Donald Olson, a Texas State University physicist, led a team of astronomers  to examine the moon's role, according to Reuters.\nNormally, icebergs stay in place and cannot move until they melt enough or a high tide  frees them. A single iceberg can become stuck many times on its journey southward. The process can take several years.\nAccording to Olson, a hundred years ago the moon made its closest approach to the Earth in more than 1,400 years. This caused the moon to have a much stronger pull on the Earth's oceans than usual, which created a super-high tide. The tide pushed icebergs from shallow waters off the coasts of Canada's provinces, Newfoundland and Labrador, into the Titanic's way.\n\"Of course, the final cause of the accident was that the ship struck an iceberg,\" Olson told Reuters. \"It went full speed into a region with icebergs, but thelunar connection  may explain how an unusually large number of icebergs got into the path of the Titanic.\"\nThe research team will publish their research in the April issue of Sky & Telescope magazine.\n,,.", "question": ".

Of course, many of us know we may eat the whole thing in the end.\nIt isn't just girls. Most of us find it hard to say 'no' to something attractive, However, scientists now say that willpower is very important to success and a happy life.\nScientists in different countries have been studying the effects of willpower on people's lives for a long time. The results are similar, according to an article on February 7 in the Guardian, a famous British newspaper.\nIn one experiment, scientists told young children that they could either have a marshmallow  now, or two marshmallows in 15 minutes. Waiting obviously needed more willpower. Scientists then continued studying the children as they grew up. They wanted to see if some children always had stronger willpower. They also wanted to see how having stronger willpower affected their lives.\nYears later, scientists found that the children who had waited for two marshmallows were all healthier, happier and richer adults. Oppositely, the children who had shown weaker willpower at that young age were more likely to be in low-paid jobs, to be overweight, to have social problems.\nBut there is hope, Roy F Baumeister, an American social psychology  professor  told the Guardian. Baumeister says we can train our willpower just like we train our muscles.  Even a little practice can strengthen our overall self-control if we do it regularly.\nYou could start by making yourself stand up straight, speaking in complete sentences, or using a computer mouse with the other hand. Scientists have found that people who manage to change little habits often perform much better in laboratory willpower tests.\nLike muscles, willpower can 'get tired'.

Some zoos even have \"friendship farms\" where people can touch some of the animals.

They give interesting information about each animal, such as where it comes from and how it lives. Special teachers at the zoo help children to understand more about the animals. Trained guides show visitors around the zoo.\nSecondly, zoos are working hard to find out more about animals. New knowledge leads to improved ways of looking after animals in the zoo, and better understanding of the same animals in the wild.\nThirdly, zoos play a part in protecting animals and stopping them from disappearing. Zoos work together with each other to help the animals in danger. For example, gorillas  from Taronga Zoo were sent to live with gorillas at the Melbourne Zoo in the hope that they would give birth to babies.\nFinally, zoos are important for people's enjoyment. People enjoy getting close to animals without having to cross the plains of Africa or climb the mountains of China. In the past, animal shows were common in zoos. Visitors were excited by monkeys in human clothes, and they even took rides on elephants or horses.
