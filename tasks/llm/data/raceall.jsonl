So, you can imagine that I was unprepared for the outpouring of public grief  at a Chinese funeral.\nMy editorial team leader died recently after a short illness. He was 31. The news was so unexpected that it left us all shocked and upset. A female colleague burst into tears and cried piteously at her desk. Somehow we got through the day's work. The next day was the funeral.\nOur big boss stepped forward to deliver a eulogy and was soon in tears. She carried on, in Chinese of course, but at the end said in English: \"There will be no more deadlines for you in heaven.\" Next came a long-term colleague who also dissolved in tears but carried on with her speech despite being almost overcome by emotion. Then a close friend of the dead man paid tribute , weeping openly as he spoke. Sorrow is spreading. Me and women were now sobbing uncontrollably. Finally, the man's mother, supported between two women, addressed her son in his coffin. At one point, the mother almost collapsed and had to be held up. We were invited to step forward to each lay a white rose on the casket. Our dead colleague looked as if he was taking a nap. At the end of the service I walked away from the funeral parlor stunned at the outpouring of emotion.\nIn the UK, families grieve privately and then try to hold it together and not break down at a funeral. Here in China it would seem that grieving is a public affair. It strikes me that it is more cathartic to cry your eyes out than try to keep it bottled up for fear of embarrassment, which is what many of us do in the West.\nAfterwards, a Chinese colleague told me that the lamenting at the funeral had been restrained  by Chinese standards. In some rural areas, she said, people used to be paid to mourn noisily. This struck me like something out of novel by Charles Dickens. But we have all seen on TV scenes of grief-stricken people in Gaza and the West Bank, in Afghanistan, Iraq and the relatives of victims of terrorist bombings around the world. Chinese grief is no different. I realized that it's the reserved British way of mourning that is out of step with the rest of the world.\nIt was our newspaper's production day. We were bussed back to the office to resume work. No more deadlines for our former colleague, but we had to pull together to put the newspaper to print.

Town meetings are still common in New England communities.\nIn recent years the town meeting idea has been widely imitated. There are open sessions of this kind on radio and television.

Among men, consistent use of mobile phones seemed not to allow more work issues to creep  into family time. But for women,  the spillover tended to go in both directions--being \"connected\" means that work cuts into home time, and family issues come into work life.\nCell phones seem to be opening more lines for stressful exchange among family members. But there may be ways to control the spillover, according to Chesley.

{"background": "Governments all over the world make public reports about the condition of their economies. Most countries, including the United States, have used a measure called the gross national product  or GNP. It includes all goods and services produced by citizens of the country anywhere in the world.\nRecently the American Commerce Department has started using a new method to measure production. It is known as the gross domestic product or GDP. It counts only goods and services that have been produced within the nation's borders. Money earned by foreign companies operating in the United States is included in the GDP, but money earned by American companies operating in other countries is not.\nEconomic experts generally approve of the change. They say that the gross domestic product provides a truer measure of the economy. They also note that most other industrial countries use this method. Therefore it will be easier to study the economies of different countries. Some officials also hope the new system will help them make better economic policy decisions. It will provide them with a clearer understanding of economic activity in the U.S. . The new measure is less likely to be affected by sudden changes in foreign oil prices or in the value of the American dollar in other countries.\nEconomic experts believe that the change from GNP to GDP will immediately reduce the value of American production by at least 40,000 million dollars a year.

{"background": "A recent online poll   asked kids what they hated most about school. \"Classes are boring\" came in first. \"Too much homework\" was a close second. Since all activities remain interesting for only so long, too much homework can lead to ennui. So, why are some kids getting homework overload? Teachers give two reasons. First, they say, the government now requires schools to meet higher-than-ever achievement goals for students. If students don' t succeed, the school faces punishment. Second, many parents want their children to be able to get into the best colleges and universities. These parents believe homework is a way to ensure that students are learning as much as possible.\nPeople who favor homework argue that it can have many beneficial effects. They claim it can help students develop good study habits. Homework can help students recognize that learning can occur at home as well as at school. It can help develop their independent learning and responsible character traits .\nBut studies show that middle school students doing 60 to 90 minutes of homework a night are doing just as well in school as those doing more than 90 minutes. And homework can have negative effects. Homework can deny students access to leisure  activities that also teach important skills. For example, sports teams teach cooperation and leadership, in addition to helping kids stay physically active. Another problem with too much homework is that parents can get too involved. They can put too much pressure on their kids.\nSo what should be done? Good homework assignments in the proper amount will have positive effects.

{"background": "Hi, everybody. On Friday, I had a discussion with working women in Rhode Island about the economic challenges they face in their own lives--challenges shared by many of you.\nThanks to the work we've all put in, our economy has come a long way these past six years. Over the past 55 months, our businesses have added 10.3 million new jobs. For the first time in six years, the unemployment rate is below 6 percent. And on Thursday, we learned that over the past six months, our economy has grown at its fastest pace since 2003.\nBut the gains of a growing economy aren't yet felt by everyone. So we've got to harness  this momentum , and make the right choices so that everyone who works hard can get ahead.\nIn recent weeks, I've talked about these choices, from raising the minimum wage to creating new jobs in construction and manufacturing. Today, I want to focus on what I discussed with those women -- the choices we need to make to help more women get ahead in today's economy.\nRight now, women make up almost half of our workers. More women are their family's main _ than ever before. So the simple truth is, when women succeed, America succeeds. And we should be choosing policies that benefit women--because that benefits all of us.\nWomen deserve fair pay. Even though it's 2014, there are women still earning less than men for doing the same work. We don't have second-class citizens in this country--we shouldn't in the workplace, either. So let's make sure women earn equal pay for equal work, and have a fair shot at success.\nWomen deserve to be able to take time off to care for a new baby, an ailing parent, or take a sick day for themselves without running into hardship. So let's make sure all Americans have access to paid family leave .\nPregnant workers deserve to be treated fairly. Even today, women can be fired for taking too many bathroom breaks, or forced on unpaid leave just for being pregnant. That's wrong--and we have to choose policies that ensure pregnant workers are treated with dignity and respect.\nNew parents deserve quality, affordable childcare. There's nothing like the peace of mind that comes with knowing that your kids are safe while you're at work. And the benefits that children get out of early enrichment can pay off for a lifetime. But in many states, sending your kid to daycare costs more than sending them to a public university. So let's start demanding Pre-K for our kids.\nAnd when most low-wage workers are women, but Congress hasn't passed a minimum wage increase in seven years, it's long past time that women deserve a raise. About 28 million workers would benefit from an increase in the minimum wage to ten dollars and ten cents an hour. And more than half of those workers are women. The local businesses where these workers spend their money would benefit, too. So let's do this -- let's give America a raise.\nAll of these policies are common sense. All of them are within our reach. We've just got to speak up and choose them. Because they'll build a stronger America for all of us.\nThanks, and have a great weekend.", "question": "Which is the true fact according to the passage?", "choices": ["During the last half year, our economy has grown fastest since 2003.", "All of us have felt the gains of a growing economy.", "We have never fires any women because of her taking too many bathroom breaks.", "The local businesses will not benefit a lot because of the increase in the minimum wage."], "answer": 0, "label": "MUL"}

It has been designed so that the wings fold up automatically; and it takes just 15 seconds to switch between flying and driving. With its wings fully open and the propeller spinning, it can take off from any airfield.\nFlying cars are quicker than traditional ones for travelling from city to city,and they can run on ordinary fuel. Another big advantage is that they are cool ,like something you would see in an action film. At the moment9however, the flying car's wheels are illegal to leave the ground. That is not because of technical reasons or problems with the design. It is because the various road and aircraft authorities simply cannot agree on whether it is a car or a plane.\n\"The government and the authorities have never thought seriously about a flying car, says Alan Price ,the president of the company that has developed it. \"I wanted a car that could fly and drive ,but it is difficult to find an organization prepared to insure the vehicle against accidents.\nNevertheless?the company hopes to produce and deliver its first flying car soon. The company already has orders for 40 of them. The majority the potential customers are older and some are retired. There have even been orders from some people who have no pilot's license.\nThe flying car will cost around $ 200.000. \"For an airplane,that's a very reasonable price, but for a car, It's quite expensive,\" explains Alan. \"But it just is not possible to make a $ 10,000 flying car yet. \"\nThis latest means of transport will not become a mass-market item in the near future,but in the long term it has the potential to change the way you travel.

When he went to college in Paris, he showed interest in looking through a microscope. A microscope makes things look a lot bigger; it lets you see things you can't see just with your eyes. Looking through a microscope, Pasteur found a living world in a drop of water. He saw and drew pictures of the small living things -- he called them \"microbes\" or \"germs\"-- that crowded in a drop of water.\nOne day a winemaker came into the lab, hoping that someone could help him with his problem. \"Sometimes my wine tastes delicious, but sometimes terrible,\" he said to Pasteur. \"Can you help me find out why?\"\nPasteur put some drops of the wine under the microscope. He noticed that the terrible wine had some unusual germs. If he killed these germs, maybe he could keep the wine from turning terrible. He tried with different ways to kill the germs. In the end he found heating   the wine seemed to work best. The winemaker tried it, and every bottle of wine tasted good.\nPasteur's idea worked for other people, too.

You may believe that every other type of pollution has a larger impact on the environment than light pollution does.

Light pollution is a problem that has been accompanying man ever since he started his first fire some 15,000 years ago. Light pollution is the light  that comes from streetlights, buildings, parking lots and any other source of light that is reflected or directed into the atmosphere.\nUrban light pollution means that one-fifth of the world's population can no longer see the Milky Way  with the naked eye . Many city kids, even if they did look through the orange smog above their heads, would probably see only a handful of stars. We have lost our view of the stars, and we have _ our  night-time environment as well. Astronomers are calling for the dark places on Earth to be preserved as national parks.\nLots of people find the ever-brightening night annoying, and animals that are programmed to prefer the dark may avoid a brightened habitat. Sea turtles can get lost searching for a beach to lay eggs, and their hatchlings may confuse over-lit beachfront resorts  for the ocean horizon, wasting precious energy needed to find the sea and escape predators . Because their necks aren't yet long enough to see things far away, baby turtles rely on the mirror image of the moon to guide them to the sea, to begin their new life. A car may even hit a particular turtle, which was thinking the light from a nearby city was moonlight reflecting off the ocean waves.

Historical evidence shows, for example, that people who lived over 3,000 years ago ate salted fish. Thousands of years ago in Egypt, salt was used to preserve   the dead.\nStealing salt was considered a major crime   during some periods of history. In the eighteenth century, for example, if a person was caught stealing salt, he could be put in prison and his ears could be cut off.\nIn the Roman Empire, one of the most important roads was the one that carried salt from the salt mines to Rome. Guards were stationed along the route to protect against salt thieves, and they received their pay in salt, thus bringing the English word, salary. Any guard who fell asleep while on duty was thought to be \"not worth his salt\", and as a result he would get a little less salt on his next payday. The expression, \"not worth his salt\", is still used today in English.\nIn the modern world salt has many uses beyond the dining table. It is used in making glass and airplane parts, in the growing of crops, and in the killing of weeds  . It is also used to make water soft, to melt   ice on roads and highways, to make soap, and to fix colors in cloth.\nSalt can be got in various ways besides being taken from mines underground.

It was founded as reaction to the popularity of unhealthy fast food. It also encourages people to buy food from local businesses, rather than large supermarkets.\nThe movement began in 1986. at that time, McDonald's wanted to open a restaurant in the centre of Rome (Italy). Food writer Carlo Perini, along with others, was against this. So, the Slow Food Organization was born. Today, it has overt 100,00 members in 132 countries.

The organization's website explains, \"The snail was chosen because it moves slowly, and calmly eats its way through life.\"\nBut Slow Food isn't just about the food we eat. It's also about how we eat it. Slow foodies say that in our fast - food world with very little time, we've forgotten that eating should be a social activity. They believe families should eat together and talk, rather than watch TV with their dinner while sitting in front of it. In fact, research has shown that if children grow up in a family that eats together at the table, they are more likely to do well in school, and less likely to have behavioral problems or devel op eating disorders.\nAnd there's more!

{"background": "Child labor -- the employment of children in industry, often against their will -- has been a problem for many years. Over a hundred years ago, Charles Dickens shocked many of his readers when he described the conditions under which young children worked in British factories. The conditions Dickens described continue almost unchanged today in many parts of the world. The only difference is that today employment of children is confined(limited)to small industries and family businesses, such as hotels, restaurants and particularly farms, rather than to large factories.\nGirls suffer more from child labor practices than boys. Many of them are forced to start work when they are only ten years old. Although the work they are given to do is often light, it is often harmful to the health. Recently, children as young as six years were found to be working in Asian factories, and the children were working from eight to fourteen hours a day in overcrowded and unhealthy working conditions. Sometimes a whole family group is employed, with the payment going to a parent or older relative.

{"background": "Science Fiction\nThe science fiction type of entertainment is considered by most to be fathered by Jules Verne (A Journey to the Center of the Earth and Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea) and H. G. Wells (The Time Machine and The War of the Worlds). Sci-Fi, as it is commonly shortened, is a fictional story in which science and technology have a significant influence on the characters and plot. Many such works are guesswork about what the future holds and how scientific findings and technological advances will shape humankind.\nWriting in the late 1800s, Jules Verne was remarkably successful in his 10 guesses about future technologies of air conditioning, automobiles, the Internet, television, and underwater, air, and space travel. Unbelievably, of all places from which to choose, Jules Verne guessed Tampa, Florida, USA as the launching site of the first project to the Moon, which was only 200 kilometers away from the actual 1969 location at Cape Canaveral, Florida.\nOne of the best-known science fiction books is Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell. Published in 1949, it was not meant as a prediction, but as a warning: Orwell was describing what he saw as the outcome of the ideas, trends, and emerging technologies of his time. Many invented terms from this novel have become common in everyday use, such as \"big brother\" and \"doublethink\". Even the author's name has been made into an adjective--Orwellian--and has become a warning descriptor for situations where privacy is lost and the individual becomes sacrifice under a totalitarian  government. Nineteen Eighty-Four was translated into sixty-five languages within five years of its publication, setting a record that still stands.\nWhat helps bring science fiction into being is usually a new discovery or innovation. The author creates an analysis of the potential influence and consequences and then wraps it in a pleasant story. For example, the beginning of space exploration was followed a few years later by the Star Trek television program and movie series. Advances in genetics  cause fantasies of the end of disease, horrors of eugenics , and thrillers where creatures disappearing long ago are brought back to life. The science fiction author's self-determined role is that of field glasses for humanity--searching the world of future possibilities upon the road which we are traveling.", "question": "According to the author, what is the role of science fiction in society?", "choices": ["A moral compass.", "A reference of technology.", "A record of science development.", "A consideration of possibilities."], "answer": 3, "label": "MUL"}

This is when the bank tells you how much money they will lend you so you have a good idea of how much you can afford.\nThe next step is to go to an estate agent and see what sort of properties they have available in your budget range and in your area. If you see something you like, the estate agent will arrange for you to view the property, so that you can see the house or flat for yourself.\nIf you see something that takes your eye, you put in an offer. The vendor   can accept or decline this offer, and if the vendor accepts it, you can move forward with the sale. However, as you don't pay any money at this point, the offer isn't legally binding  , and in theory, you can pull out of the offer at any time that you like.\nYour next step will probably be to get a structural survey done. A qualified surveyor will inspect the house and write a report that illustrates any structural problems, like damp or drainage problems.\nIf you still want to go ahead with the sale, you need to appoint a lawyer to do the legal paperwork, if you already own a house you might also be busy trying to sell it Many house owners prefer to sell to first-time buyers (those people who don't already own a home), as they are not in a chain (waiting for other people to buyer house before they can buy their next house).\nFinally, once the contracts are signed and exchanged, you complete on your house.

During the Roman Empire, lots of roads were built in order to move armies, send messages by courier  , and make trade easier. This construction work went on for five centuries! If all the roads built during the Roman Empire were put together end to end, they would circle the equator twice.\nThe network of Roman roads was begun in 312 BC. It was demanded that the roads be built strong so that they would not fall down. Roman soldiers, supervised   by engineers, laid down the roads in a special pattern of layers. The first layer was made of sand. Next, the builders added rocks and rubble. On top of these materials came gravel. On this solid foundation, the road builders placed paving stones.\nAlso, Roman roads were cambered. This means that they were built higher in the middle than on the edges, allowing rainwater to run off, which prevented flooding. We use the same technique in building roads today. The Romans also laid out roads over hills when necessary, setting them down in a zigzag pattern to make the road rise gradually.\nAll Roman roads had milestones  , placed every thousands paces (a Roman mile). The milestones told when the road was built, who was emperor at the time, the road's destination, how far the traveler was from the destination, and how many miles had been traveled since the beginning of the road. This information was a great help to travelers.\nBecause of their excellence in construction, it really is no surprise that many parts of Roman road still exist today.

Violin makers and scientists try to make instruments like the old Italian violins. But they aren't the same. Why are these old Italian violins so special? Many people think they have an answer.\nSome people think it is the age of the violins. But there is a problem here. Not all old violins sound wonderful. Only those from Cremona are special. So age cannot be the answer.\nOther people think the secret to those violins is the wood. The wood of the violin is very important. It must be from certain kinds of trees. It must not be too young or too old. Perhaps the violin makers of Cremona knew something special about wood for violins.\nBut the kind of wood may not be so important. It may be more important to cut the wood in a special way. Wood for a violin must be cut very carefully. It has to be the right size and shape. The smallest difference will change the sound of the violin. Musicians sometimes think that this is the secret of the Italians.\nSize and shape may not be the answer either. Scientists make new violins that are exactly the same size and shape. But the new violins still do not sound as good as the old one. Some scientists think the secret may be the varnish , which covers the wood of the violin and makes it look shiny. It also helps the sound of the instrument. Since no one knows what the Italian violin makers used in their varnish, no one can make the same varnish today.\nThere may never be other violins like the violins of Cremona.

If you can spare two or three hours a day, break them up into some periods to avoid brain getting tired.\nGo over each lesson several times, perhaps once in the morning, once in the evening and once several days later. Give your brain time to understand the material, but the break between periods of study shouldn't be too long, or you will forget most of what you've learned.\nMake sure you're comfortable with the bases of the language before learning the more advanced knowledge. Without full understanding of basic knowledge such as words pronunciation and spelling, you'll find it very difficult to learn more.\nSetting proper targets is a good way to encourage yourself. You could set yourself a time limit or aim for a certain level.\nOnce you have mastered the bases of the language, learn to apply them to the things that you're interested in. In this way you are more likely to remember the words, phrases and grammatical constructions you meet.\nYou will find that at times you're making rapid progress, while sometimes you seem to stand still or even go backwards. This is normal when learning a language, so don't be discouraged.\nMaking mistakes in a foreign language is nothing to worry about.

However, if you're eating at a lower-end  restaurant a tip is not necessary. If you're staying at one of Bangkok's many five-star hotels, expect to tip the porter 20 to 50 baht , depending on how many bags you have. Taxis are now metered in Bangkok. Local custom is to round the fare  up to the nearest five baht.\nHong Kong\nTipping is customary in this money-mad metropolis . Most restaurants add a 10% service charge to the bill, but the extra money often ends up in the pocket of the owner. If the service is good, add another 10% to the bill, up to HK $100 in an especially nice restaurant. For HK $10 hotel porters should do it at all but the nicest hotels where a new HK $20 bill may be more acceptable. When in a taxi, round up  to the nearest dollar.\nKuala Lumpur\nTipping in Malaysia is limited to the expensive Westernized hotels, which often add a 10% service charge to your meal or hotel room. If you are at a hotel restaurant, expect a 10% service charge. But at local restaurants, there's no need to add a tip. At five-star hotels, one or two ringgit  will content a porter. At lower-end buildings don't feel you have to tip. Like Bangkok, many taxis are now metered so you can just round up to the nearest ringgit.\nSeoul\nTipping is not part of Korean culture, although it has become a matter of course in international hotels where a 10% service charge is often added. If you're at a Korean barbecue joint , there's no need to add anything extra. But a nice Italian restaurant may require a 10% contribution. If you're at a top-end hotel, so expect to pay 500~1 000 won per bag. Taxi drivers don't accept a tip.

They believe politicians could learn a lot from recent advances in science. A growing number of studies have shown that people do judge a book by its cover. Researchers say most of us make quick judgments about a person on the basis of how they look.\n  Studies suggest that people are less likely to trust those with particularly masculine  features, such as a square jaw, small eyes or a big nose. \" They are considered dominant  and less trustworthy,\" says Ms Cornwell. \"It doesn't mean that men who look more masculine are less trustworthy-----it's just our first impression.\" Those with less masculine features-----larger eyes, a smaller nose and thinner lips are thought to be more trustworthy.\n  The researchers are putting their science to the test at the Royal Society's annual summer exhibition in London. They have copied the faces of Prime Minister Tony Blair, Conservative leader Michael Howard and Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy stressing their dominant and trustworthy features. \" We have used a computer program to change the shape of their faces and features.

{"background": "Attitude is an internal  state that influences the choices of personal action made by the individual . Some researchers consider that attitudes come from differences between beliefs and ideas; others believe that attitudes come from emotional states. Here, we focus on the effects of attitudes upon behavior, that is, upon the choices of action made by the individual.\nThe kinds of actions taken by human beings are obviously influenced greatly by attitudes. Whether one listens to classical music or rock, whether one obeys the speed limit while driving, whether one encourages one's husband or wife to express his or her own ideas-all are influenced by attitudes. These internal states are acquired  throughout life from situations one is faced with in the home, in the streets, and in the school.\nOf course, the course of action chosen by an individual in any situation will be largely determined by the particulars of that situation. An individual who has a strong attitude of obeying laws may drive too fast when he is in a hurry and no police cars in sight. A child who has a strong attitude of honesty may steal a penny when she thinks no one will notice. But the internal state which remains unchanged over a period of time, and which makes the individual behave regularly in a variety of situations, is what is meant by an attitude.\nAttitudes are learned in a variety of ways. They can result from single events, as when an attitude toward snakes is acquired by an experience in childhood at the sudden movement of a snake. They can result from the individual's experiences of success and pleasure, as when someone acquires a positive attitude toward doing crossword puzzles by being able to complete some of them. And frequently, they are learned by copying other people's behavior, as when a child learns how to behave toward foreigners by observing the actions of his parents.

But after the hustle and bustle of a few weeks, excitement gives way to a less enjoyable emotion-- homesickness.\nHomesickness manifests itself in many ways. You may miss mum's cooking, your pets, or even your old bed. All this becomes a fond memory of the past. Homesickness can be a bitter feeling for many students, especially when faced with the challenges of settling into an unfamiliar environment.\nBut remember, you're not alone. According to a recent BBC article, 70 percent of British college students experience homesickness. In this increasingly globalized world in which people migrate to faraway places for a relationship, education or work, homesickness is a feeling shared by many adults.\nHomesickness can have similar symptoms to depression and in extreme cases it can develop into a panic attack. As for the term, homesickness or nostalgia wasn't invented until the 17th century. It was considered a disorder by a Swiss physician, who attributed soldiers' mental and physical discomfort to their longing to return home, \"nostos\" from Greek, and the accompanying pain, \"algos\".\nStudies in recent years, however, have shown that nostalgia may have some benefits to our mental health. After a decade of surveys and researches, Constantine Sedikides, a US social psychologist, found that nostalgia is what makes us human.

Each of these groups has its own number, such as 100, 200, etc. So, for example, any books about language will have a number 400. On the other hand, any books about history will have a number 900.

If you find a book that has a number in the 500s, you know it is a book about science.\nHowever, science is a big group, so the tens place is used to make a more detailed set of science books. For example, math books are included in the group of science books. Math books all have numbers between 510 and 519. Books about the history of Africa have numbers between 960 and 969.\nThe system uses the ones place to give a more exact limit for the subject of a book.

{"background": "\"What is the most important thing you've done in your life?\" The question was put to me during a presentation I gave to a group of lawyers.\nThe answer came to me in an instant. It's not the one I gave, because the situation was not right. As a lawyer in the entertainment industry, I knew the audience wanted to hear some amusing stories about my work with well-known people, but here's the true answer:\nThe most important thing I've ever done occurred on October 8,1990. I began the day playing tennis with an old friend I hadn't seen for a while. Between points we talked about what had been happening in each other's lives. He and his wife had just had a baby boy, who was keeping them up at night.\nWhile we were playing, a car came screaming up the road toward the courts. It was my friend's father, who shouted to my friend that his baby had stopped breathing and was being rushed to the hospital. In a flash my friend was in the car and gone, disappearing in a cloud of dust.\nFor a moment I just stood there, paralyzed . Then I tried to figure out what I should do. Follow my friend to the hospital? There was nothing I could accomplish there, I convinced myself. My friend's son was in the care of doctors and nurses, and nothing I could do or say would affect the outcome. Be there for moral support? Well, maybe. But my friend and his wife both had large families, and I knew they'd be surrounded by relatives who would provide more than enough comfort and support, whatever happened. All I could do at the hospital, I decided, was to get in the way. Also, I had planned a full day with my family, who were waiting for me to get home. So I decided to head back to my house and check in my friend later.\nAs I started my car, I realized that my friend had left his truck and keys at the courts. I now faced another problem. I couldn't leave the keys in the truck. So I decided to go to the hospital and give him the keys.\nWhen I arrived, I was directed to a room where my friend and his wife were waiting. As I had thought, the room was filled with family members silently watching my friend comfort his wife. I went in and stood by the door, trying to decide what to do next. Soon a doctor appeared. He approached my friend and his wife, and in a quiet voice told them that their son had died.\nFor a long time the two held each other and cried, unaware of the rest of us standing around in pained silence. After they had calmed themselves, the doctor suggested they spend a few moments with their son.\nMy friend and his wife stood up and walked past their families. When they reached the door, my friend saw me standing in the corner. He came over and hugged me and started to cry. My friend's wife hugged me, too, and said , \"Thanks for being here.\"\nFor the rest of that morning, I sat in the emergency room of that hospital and watched my friend and his wife hold the body of their infant son, and say goodbye.\nIt's the most important thing I have ever done. The experience taught me two lessons.\nFirst: The most important thing I've ever done happened when I was completely helpless. None of the things I had learned in university, in three years of law school or in six years of legal practice were of any use in that situation. Something terrible was happening to people I cared about, and I was powerless to change the outcome. All I could do was standing by and watching it happen. And yet it was critical that I do just that--- just be there when someone needed me.\nSecond: The most important thing I've done almost didn't happen because of things I had learned in classroom and professional life. Law school taught me how to take a set of facts, break them down and organized them. These skills are critical for lawyers. When people come to us for help, they're often stressed out and depend on a lawyer to think logically. But while learning to think, I almost forget how to feel. Today I have no doubt that I should have leapt into my car without hesitation and followed my friend to the hospital.\nFrom that one experience I learned that the most important thing in life isn't the money you make, the status you attain or the honors you achieve.", "question": "Which of the following is conveyed in this story?", "choices": ["Family and relatives can not take the place of friends.", "More people are a great comfort when one is in trouble.", "It is best to be here when someone needs you.", "You can certainly help a friend if you want to."], "answer": 2, "label": "MUL"}

{"background": "Wilderness\n\"In wilderness  is the preservation of the world.\" This is a famous saying from a writer regarded as one of the fathers of environmentalism. The frequency with which it is borrowed mirrors a heated debate on environmental protection: whether to place wilderness at the heart of what is to be preserved.\nAs John Sauven of Greenpeace UK points out, there is a strong appeal in images of the wild, the untouched; more than anything else, they speak of the nature that many people value most dearly. The urge to leave the subject of such images untouched is strong, and the danger exploitation  brings to such landscapes  is real. Some of these wildernesses also perform functions that humans need--the rainforests, for example, store carbon in vast quantities. To Mr.Sauven, these \"ecosystem services\" far outweigh the gains from exploitation.\nLee Lane, a visiting fellow at the Hudson Institute, takes the opposing view. He acknowledges that wildernesses do provide useful services, such as water conservation. But that is not, he argues, a reason to avoid all human presence, or indeed commercial and industrial exploitation. There are ever more people on the Earth, and they reasonably and rightfully want to have better lives, rather than merely struggle for survival. While the ways of using resources have improved, there is still a growing need for raw materials, and some wildernesses contain them in abundance. If they can be tapped without reducing the services those wildernesses provide, the argument goes, there is no further reason not to do so. Being untouched is not, in itself, a characteristic worth valuing above all others.\nI look forwards to seeing these views taken further, and to their being challenged by the other participants. One challenge that suggests itself to me is that both cases need to take on the question of spiritual value a little more directly. And there is a practical question as to whether wildernesses can be exploited without harm.\nThis is a topic that calls for not only free expression of feelings, but also the guidance of reason.

This is not a small effect.\"\nInstead of looking at the health ills caused by future global warming, as past studies have done, this research looks at the immediate benefits of doing something about the problem, said Linda Birnbaum, director of the US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.\nSome possible benefits seemed highly speculative, the researchers conceded, based on people driving less and walking and cycling more. Other proposals studied were more concrete and achievable, such as reducing cook stoves that burn dung , charcoal and other polluting fuels in the developing world.\nAnd cutting carbon dioxide emissions also makes the air cleaner, reducing lung damage for millions of people, doctors said.\n\"Here are ways you can attack major health problems at the same time as dealing with climate change,\" said lead author Dr. Paul Wilkinson, an environmental epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\nWilkinson said the individual studies came up with numbers of premature deaths prevented or extra years of life added for certain places.\nFor example, switching to low-polluting cars in London and Delhi, India, would save 160 lost years of life in London and nearly 1,700 in Delhi for every million residents, one study found.

{"background": "Being young is great. Most of the parts of your body still work great, you have a full head of hair, you're energetic, and you have a world of opportunity in front of you. However, there's going to come a time when you start to get older. And as you get older, you'll have new responsibilities, complete independence, and perhaps most importantly, less time to recover from mistakes.\nYou see, we all make mistakes in life. Maybe you spent more money than you should have on a car, you passed up on a great job opportunity, or you didn't try as hard as you could have in school. It's a part of life and we learn from it. But there are certain mistakes that are much better made while you're still young and have plenty of time to recover.\nI'm definitely not telling you that you should purposely go out and make these mistakes (because they're a pain to recover from). But these are all mistakes that are much better made when you're younger so that you can learn from them and not have them ruin your entire life.\nStarting the wrong career\nWouldn't you hate to be 45 years old and discover that you absolutely hate what you do for a living? It's a reality that a lot of people face and it can be difficult to fix. You see, when you're 23 and find out you don't like the career path you've chosen, you can easily explore new career options.\nWe no longer live in an age when people are expected to stay with one company until they retire. You can bounce around a little bit and find out what you want to do. When you get older, just switching careers whenever you want isn't as simple.\nYou have to consider your family, retirement, the difficulties you might run into with starting from the bottom in a new industry, and plenty of other issues that someone in their early 20's just doesn't have to deal with.\nDating the wrong person\nThe divorce rate in the U.S is extremely high. Other parts of the world aren't doing too much better either. While everyone gets divorced for their own reasons, I think we can all agree that it's better to find out that the person you're with is wrong for you sooner rather than later.\nHopefully you find out whether or not the person you're with is right for you before you tie the knot, because around 50% of first marriages end in divorce.\nMessing up your credit\nRuining your credit is never a good idea. Even if you ruin it while you're young, it could affect you in the future. The upside of having bad credit while you're young instead of older is that you have time to build it back up.\nIt can take 7-10 years to rebuild your credit if you have a history of late payments, loan defaults, foreclosures, or bankruptcy. During those 7-10 years, you'll have a hard time financing anything unless you have a cosigner or put down a substantial down payment.\nMost people tend to make most of the bigger purchases in life when they get older such as a house or their dream car. If you have bad credit, you can kiss all of that goodbye.\nMaking bad investments\nIf you're investing money for your retirement, making bad decisions can mean you'll be working your entire life. Whether you choose to pay someone to do the investing for you or handle it all yourself, it's a lot better to take risks when you're younger.\nIf you invest in stock or even real estate while you're young and the market takes a hit, you're not ruined. Investing is a long-term venture, so the younger you start, the more fluctuation you can withstand and still come out with a positive return.\nBlowing your money\nWhat would you do if you went broke at 60 years old? You would be working your behind off when you really should be relaxing and getting ready to retire soon.\nBut if you're 25 and broke, you still have plenty of time to earn more money. Also, nobody will judge you because it's not unusual for people in their 20's to not have money these days. You might have blown your money on a nice car or have an obsession with all the newest gadgets.\nWhen you get older, you'll be able to look back and realize how dumb you were for spending $20,000 on a brand new car when you were only 20 years old.

The action follows recent reports about the storing of information on the Apple iPhone. Some people consider location tracking to be a threat to personal privacy and security.\nAllan Friedman, the research director, says, \"All wireless companies do some location tracking as part of their networks. This information is usually stored by the companies, not the devices, and there are laws to protect it.

We don't expect you to take up jogging, backpacking, or hang gliding. we ask the sedentary vacationers to spend two to four hours a day doing things, such as walking the city streets, exploring a nature preserve, or taking a leisurely rowboat ride.\nThese kinds of activities aren't just good for your physical health. They improve your mental health, even your spiritual health. And they make vacations memorable and worthwhile. Here are some fresh ideas for active and healthy vacation.\nMake the morning your activity time. At that time it is most likely that the weather will be friendlier, your energy level higher, and your schedule emptier than later in the day.\nHave a walk at dawn or dusk. Such activity is called rejuvenation .

{"background": "A few months ago as I wandered through my parents' house, the same house I grew up in, I had a sudden, scary realization. When my parents bought the house, in 1982, they were only two years older than I am now. I tried to imagine myself in two years, ready to settle down and buy the house I'd still be living in almost 30 years later.\n    It seemed ridiculous. On a practical level, there's no way I could afford to buy a house anytime soon. More importantly, I wouldn't want to. I'm not sure where I'll be living in two years, or what kind of job I'll have. And I don't think I'll be ready to settle down and stay in one place.\n    So this is probably the generation gap that divides my friends and me from our parents. When our parents were our age, they'd gotten their education, chosen a career, and were starting to settle into responsible adult lives.\n    My friends and I - \"Generation Y\" - still aren't sure what we want to do with our lives. Whatever we end up doing, we want to make sure we're happy doing it. We'd rather take risks first, try out different jobs, and move from one city to another until we find our favorite place. We'd rather spend our money on travel than put it in a savings account.\n    This casual attitude toward responsibility has caused some critics to call my generation \"arrogant\", \"impatient\", and \"overprotected\". Some of these complaints have a point. As children ,we were encouraged to succeed in school, but also to have fun. We grew up in a world full of technological innovation: cellphones, the Internet, instant messaging, and video games.\n    Our parents looked to rise vertically --starting at the bottom of the ladder and slowly making their way to the top, on the same track, often for the same company. That doesn't apply to my generation.\n    Because of that, it may take us longer than our parents to arrive at responsible, stable adulthood. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. In our desire to find satisfaction, we will work harder, strive for ways to keep life interesting, and gain a broader set of experiences and knowledge than our parents' generation did.  \nBy Ariel Lewiton", "question": "What is the main \"generation gap\" between the author and her friends and their parents according to the article?", "choices": ["Their attitude toward high technology.", "Their ways of making their way to the top.", "Their attitude towards responsibility.", "Their ways of gaining experience."], "answer": 2, "label": "MUL"}

We can put on more clothes, stay next to a fireplace, turn on the air conditioner or simply travel to a warmer city to spend the winter - people have many different ways of dealing with the cold.\nBut things are not as easy for plants. Unlike humans, plants can't move to escape the cold or generate heat ( ) to keep themselves warm. So how do they manage to survive the freezing winter?\nIt turns out that plants have their own strategies   too, said a study published on Dec 22 in the journal Nature.\nAccording to researcher Amy Zanne of George Washington University, US, the cold is a big challenge for plants. Their living tissues   can be damaged when they freeze. \"It's like a plant's equivalent to frostbite ( ),\" Zanne told Science Daily. Also, the process of freezing and thawing    can cause air bubbles   to form in the plant's water transport system. \"If enough of these air bubbles come together as water thaws they can block the flow of water from the roots to the leaves and kill the plant,\" she explained.\nTo live through cold weather, plants have developed three traits   , according to the study. Some plants, such as oak trees , avoid freezing damage by dropping their leaves before the winter chill sets in - effectively shutting off the flow of water between roots and leaves - and growing new leaves and water transport cells when the warm spring returns.\nOther plants, pine trees  for example, protect themselves by narrowing their water transport cells, which makes it easier for cells to travel among air bubbles.\nThe third strategy is also the most extreme - some plants die on the ground in winter and start growing as new plants from seeds when conditions get warmer.\nHowever, the study also found that these smart strategies were developed very slowly - over millions\nof years of evolution ( ).

{"background": "Cyberspace, the connections between computers in different places, considered as a real place where information, messages and pictures exist, mirrors the real world in many ways. People ask for information, play games, and share hobbies. Others buy and sell products. Still others look for friendship, or even love.\nUnlike the real world, however, your knowledge about a person is limited to words on a computer screen. Identity and appearance mean very little in cyberspace. Rather, a person's thoughts--or at least the thoughts they type--are what really count. So even the shyest person can become a chat room star.\nUsually, this \"faceless\" communication doesn't create problems. Identity doesn't really matter when you're in a chat room discussing politics or hobbies. In fact, this emphasis(,) on the ideas themselves makes the Internet a great place for exciting conversation. Where else can so many people come together to chat? But some Internet users want more than just someone to chat with. They're looking for serious love relationships. Is cyberspace a good place to find love? That answer depends on whom you ask. Some of these relationships actually succeed. Others fail miserably.\nSupporters of online relationships state that the Internet allows couples to get to know each other intellectually first. Personal appearance doesn't get in the way. But critics of online relationships argue that no one can truly know another person in cyberspace. Why? Because the Internet gives users a lot of control over how others view them. Internet users can carefully craft their words to fit whatever image they want to give. And they don't have to worry about what their \"nonverbal\"  communication is doing for their image. In a sense, they're not really themselves.\nAll of this may be fine if the relationship stays in cyberspace. But not knowing a person is a big problem in a love relationship. With so many unknowns, it's easy to let one's imagination \"fill in the blanks.\" This inevitably  leads to disappointment when couples meet in person. How someone imagines an online friend is often quite more different than the real person. So, before looking for love in cyberspace, remember the advice of Internet pioneer Clifford Stoll: \"Life in the real world is far richer than anything you'll find on a computer screen.\"", "question": "By saying \"With so many unknowns, it's easy to let one's imagination 'fill in the blanks'\", the writer means that   _  .", "choices": ["the Internet allows people to get more information about their loved ones", "the Internet makes it easy for people to imagine how others view them", "people usually get to know each other by chance through the Internet", "people may be disappointed when they meet in person"], "answer": 3, "label": "MUL"}

So every September I go to Paris and take a train from the great French city to Mendova, and at Mendova I catch my ship.\nThere is one very fast train from Paris to Mendova, and it suits me well.

In a short time the corridor was full too, and it was impossible for any more travelers to get into the train.\nI could see a lot of other people outside the corridor windows, but they could not get in, and the train left Paris without them.

How much money do they pay you every year? How much do you have in the bank? How much do you spend every month?\"\nHe asked questions for about twenty minutes but I did not give him any clear answers, and at last he stopped and began to read the paper.\nI usually sleep quite well in the train, but this time I slept only a little.

In order to get out of the train, I had to pass down the corridor to the door at the far end. There was no other way out.\nI could not even into the corridor. There was a suitcase on the floor by my feet, and three men were standing in my way. I felt a touch of fear. I had to get out, you see; I had to catch my ship, which left at half past eleven.

Instead, many foreigners come to Shanghai to settle in the city. They are attracted by the life in Shanghai and choose to stay in the city. Their stay has made Shanghai more like an international city.\nEarly in the 1990s, a group of Western-style buildings _ at the Gubei New District in the southwestern part of the Hongqiao Development Zone in Shanghai. The Western-style buildings, marked by their great arches and the typical flavors of the unique European style, appealed to many foreigners and become their favorite choice when they came to live or work in Shanghai. Foreigners gathered in the zone, enjoying their quiet life there.\nAs the city further develops, more and more foreigners choose to live in the downtown area where most native Shanghai people live. They live close to local residents and gradually become interated into the local life--they learn to cook local dishes, they learn to speak the Shanghai dialect and they celebrate traditional Chinese holidays together with native people. Their lifestyle is becoming more and more similar to that of local residents.\nIn the past, foreigners that came to Shanghai were mostly representatives sent to work in the city.

In 1850, Curtis began selling flavored gums.\nPizza--In Italy in the early 1700s, flat breads, called pizzas, were made without toppings.These tasty,filling breads were sold to the poor in Naples.When Maria Carolina, the queen of Naples, tasted one, she persuaded her husband, King Ferdinand IV, to allow this peasant dish to be made in the royal kitchen.Almost 200 years later,during her travels around the country, Italy's queen Margherita saw Italian peasants eating pizza breads.She had a taste and fell in love with pizza. She ordered the most famous pizza cook of the day, Raffaele Esposito, to create for her a pizza made of tomato, basil, and cheese to look like the color1s of the Italian flag. This remains the basis of the American version of the pizza.\nThe ice-cream-cone--In 1904, Italo Marchiony got a patent  to produce ice-cream cones. The same year at the ST. Louis World's Fair, a Syrian waffle  seller Ernest Hamwi heard that a nearby ice-cream seller had run out of dishes to serve his cream. Hamwi rolled some of his waffles into a cone  shape and offered them to his neighbor, who put ice-cream in the cones and sold them. This first fully eatable, portable  treat was a hit with customers immediately.\nM&Ms--During the Spanish Civil War of the 1930s, Forrest Mars, Sr., saw soldiers eating pieces of chocolate covered with a hard sugary coating, which kept the chocolate from melting in the sun.

This special liking for mathematics and science is partly explained by the fact that Asian-American students who began their education abroad arrived in the U. S. with a solid grounding in mathematics but little or no knowledge of English. They are also influenced by the promise of a good job after college. Asians feel there will be less unfair treatment in areas like mathematics and science because they will be judged more objectively. And the return on the investment in education is more immediate in something like engineering than with an arts degree.\nMost Asian-American students owe their success to the influence of parents who are determined that their children take full advantage of what the American educational system has to offer. An effective measure of parental attention is homework. Asian parents spend more time with their children than American parents do, and it helps. Many researchers also believe there is something in Asian culture that breeds success, such as ideals that stress family values and emphasize education.\nBoth explanations for academic success worry Asian Americans because of fears that they feed a typical racial image. Many can remember when Chinese, Japanese and Filipino immigrants were the victims of social isolation. Indeed, it was not until 1952 that laws were laid down giving all Asian immigrants the right to citizenship.", "question": "Why do \"both explanations\" (Para. 3) worry Asian Americans?", "choices": ["They are afraid they will again be isolated from American society in general.", "People will think that Asian students only rely on their parents for success.", "Asian Americans will be a threat to other minorities.", "American academic achievements have taken on too strong an Asian character."], "answer": 0, "label": "MUL"}

But Morrison is also the first and only American-born Nobel prizewinner for literature since 1962, the year novelist John Steinbeck received the award.\nLike Song of Solomon, Love is a multigenerational story, revealing the personal and communal Legacy  of an outstanding black family. As Morrison scholars will tell you, Love is the third volume of a literary master's trilogy investigating the many complexities of love. This trilogy began with Beloved(1988), which deals with a black mother's love under slavery and in freedom. Jazzy(1993), the second volume, tells a story of romantic love in 1920s Harlem. This latest novel looks back from the 1970s to the 1940s and 50s.\nThe emotional center of Love is Bill Cosey, the former owner and host of the shabby Cosey's Hotel and Resort in Silk, North Carolina, described in the novel as \"the best and best-known vacation sport for colored folk on the East Coast.\" We get to know Cosey through the memories of five women who survive and love him: his granddaughter, his widow, two former employees, and a homeless young girl.\nThe latest novel, Love, had been described in the promotional material from her publisher as \"Morrison's most accessible work since Song of Solomon.\" This comparison to her third novel, published in 1977, was an effective selling point.", "question": "The similarity between Love and Song of Solomon is that they both   _  .", "choices": ["belong to the same trilogy together with Beloved", "concern families of more than one generation", "deal with life of blacks under slavery", "investigate life in 1920s Harlem"], "answer": 1, "label": "MUL"}

Yet France may raise the age limit for beer and wine sales to eighteen, the same as for hard liquor there.\n    Rules on alcohol differ from college to college in the United States. Many schools require all first-year students to take an alcohol prevention and education program, often given online. Some have a \"zero tolerance\" policy where alcohol is banned from all buildings. Parents are informed of violations  and students may be suspended . \n     At the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, permission is needed to serve alcohol at any event on campus. But alcohol is banned in first-year dorms --- where most students are under twenty-one anyway. \n     Susan Davis, a university lawyer, says campus police and local police report underage drinking violations to administrators. The university judicial committee decides punishment on a case by case basis. For example, the committee might suspend or expel a student. It might require an alcohol education program. Or it might just give a warning.\n     Jon Zug is a prosecutor  in Albemarle County, where the university is located.

He has four kids and has seen the trend most with his 16-year-old. \"I start to see it in our 10-year-old as well, because he is reading less and less, and more and more attracted to some of the digital media platforms that he has access to, and that he didn't have access to when he was 6 or 7 years old,\" he says.\nThe studies don't say that kids are reading less because they're spending more time online.

The 47-year-old from Hong Kong University was one of five women scientists, from each continent, to receive the 2011 L'Oreal-UNESCO For Women in Science Awards at a ceremony on March 3, at UNESCO Headquarters in Paris. It is the 13th edition of the award since 1998.\nYam's long and fruitful research on solving the energy problem won her the prize for Asia and the Pacific. There are several renewable and sustainable  energy solutions, like solar power, which could provide an unlimited source of energy. Some problems must be resolved, however, such as the low efficiency of solar cells and their high supply costs. Yam and her colleagues hope to overcome these problems by developing and testing new photoactive  materials.\nShe became the third Chinese women scientist honored with the so-called \"woman's Nobel Prize\" award, after Professor Li Fanghua from the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2003, and Professor Ye Ruyu from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2004.\n\"People think chemists are bad guys, but we are the good guys,\" Yam said in a humorous aside before explaining her research project on photoactive materials in an earlier speech at L'Institut de France. For Yam, chemistry is science, but also an art. Amazed by the universe, nature and color1 in her childhood, Yam decided on a career in chemistry. \"One of the beauties of chemistry is the ability to create new molecules and chemical species. I have always associated chemists with artists, creating new things with innovative  ideas,\" Yam said.\nAs a mother of two daughters, 12 and 14, Yam said she is lucky to have been supported by her family. She was inspired as a child by her father, a professor in the Civil Engineering Faculty at Hong Kong University. Yam added her husband, Mak Shingtat, a PhD in chemistry, who accompanied Yam to the awards ceremony, was also fully supportive of her work. \"I can't imagine how my career could move on without his understanding and support,\" she said. \"I often stay late at night in the laboratory. He always waits for me outside.\"\nYam received her bachelor and PhD degrees from the University of Hong Kong (HKU). She taught at City Polytechnic of Hong Kong before joining HKU as a faculty member, and headed the chemistry department for two terms from 2000 to 2005. At 38, she was the youngest member elected to the Chinese Academy of Sciences. She is also a Fellow of TWAS, the Academy of Sciences for the Developing World, and was awarded the State Natural Science Award and the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) Centenary Medal. 2011 is the 100th anniversary of Marie Curie's second Nobel Prize, coinciding  with the International Year of Chemistry. Today, Curie is still a role model for women in science.\nAlthough the participation of women in science, is promoted by UNESCO, notably through L'Oreal-UNESCO, there are still too few women doing high-level science, says UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova. The latest UNESCO report shows less than 40 percent of countries provide girls and boys equal access to education.\nEach year, the L'Oreal-UNESCO For Women in Science Award _ 15 young women from all over the world, especially developing countries, to encourage and finance their studies. More than 200 young women scientists are currently supported. \"I do not think there is a difference between men and women in terms of their intellectual abilities and research capabilities ,\" Yam said. \"As long as one has the passion, dedication and determination to pursue research wholeheartedly, one can excel regardless of one's gender or background.\"\nYam said some young women, who require stability and security, often have to give up their research because of family pressures. \"The only way for women to succeed in science is to get the mental and material support from family and society. There is a day-care center at my university, and my husband and mother-in-law help a lot with the housework, so I am able to spend my time on research,\" she said. \"I have two young daughters, and it is too early to tell whether or not they want to pursue careers in science. But, I will encourage them to always defend their ideas. To remain determined, and to never be afraid of failure - this is the advice that they will need to succeed in realizing their dreams.\" \nYam also acknowledged her colleague's support, at the awards ceremony. \"This (award) not only recognizes me, but my colleagues and students and my country, China.\"", "question": "The word \"recognize\" in the passage means   _  .", "choices": ["admit or be aware of", "be willing to accept sb/sth as valid or approve", "show appreciation by giving an honor or award", "know sb/sth again"], "answer": 2, "label": "MUL"}

In a world supposed to be moved by hunger and by love, Mrs. Packletide's movements were largely governed by dislike of Loona Bimberton.\nCircumstances proved favorable. Mrs. Packletide had offered a thousand rupees   for the opportunity of shooting a tiger without risk or effort, and it happened that an old tiger was frequently coming to a neighboring village at night. He was so old that he couldn't kill animals in the wild and just satisfied his appetite to the smaller household animals. The villagers were eager to earn the thousand rupees; children were posted night and day in the jungle to watch the tiger, and the cheap goats were left about to keep him from going elsewhere. The one great fear was that he should die of old age before the day of Mrs. Packletide's shoot.\nThe great night arrived. A platform had been built in a tree, on which sat Mrs. Packletide and her paid companion, Miss Mebbin. A goat with a loud bleat   was tied down at the correct distance. With an accurate gun, they waited for the coming of the tiger.\n\"I suppose we are in some danger?\" said Miss Mebbin.\nShe was not actually nervous about the wild beast, but she was unwilling to perform a bit more service than she had been paid for.\n\"It's a very old tiger. It couldn't spring up here even if it wanted to.\" said Mrs. Packletide.\nTheir conversation was cut short by the appearance of the old tiger. He saw the goat, and lay on the earth for a short rest before attacking.\nThe gun fired very loudly, and the great yellow beast jumped to one side and then rolled over in the stillness of death. In a moment a crowd of excited villagers appeared on the scene, and their shouting carried the glad news to the village.\nIt was Miss Mebbin who found that the goat was dying from a bullet-wound, while no wound could be found on the tiger.

According to the company's founder Doniece Sandoval, every bus will be renewed and equipped with two separate private areas, each with a shower stall, sink, changing areas, toilet and bench. Sandoval says that if everyone sticks to a five-minute shower, a single Lava Mae bus could provide service for about 100 people during each 8- to 10-hour shift. \nThe project has been several years in the making as it has not been easy to get officials to agree. In addition, it is also difficult to ask the bus company to donate buses.

{"background": "Lawmakers in the United States have expanded an investigation into the use of location-tracking systems on mobile devices. The action follows recent reports about the storing of information on the Apple iPhone. Some people consider location tracking to be a threat to personal privacy and security.\nAllan Friedman, the research director, says, \"All wireless companies do some location tracking as part of their networks. This information is usually stored by the companies, not the devices, and there are laws to protect it. Law enforcement  agencies, for example, have to have a fairly high standard before it can access that data. And the phone company is also prohibited from selling that information.\nNow, two researchers report that location tracking information is being stored directly on Apple devices. They said Apple's newest operating systems gather global positioning system and timestamp information. The information is stored on the device in a file that is also uploaded   to any computer that the device is connected to. The researchers say the information is available to anyone who has access to the device or computer.\nAllan Friedman says, \"This raises additional concerns. There's the idea that because it's on my phone and on my computer, rogue applications  that I pay for or that I'm tricked into downloading may be able to access this data and somehow misuse it.\"\nApple says it is \"not tracking the location of your iPhone\". It is simply keeping a database of Wi-Fi hotspots and cell phone towers near the user's location. This information is meant to help the iPhone quickly find its location when needed.\nLetters have been sent to some of the leading mobile device developers, including Apple and Google. The letters asked for more information about their location tracking systems. Allan Friedman calls this an important start to strengthening privacy laws. He says, \"There aren't strong controls over things like location information, what they are doing with it, how long they are keeping it.

We don't realize that people in other places often get married in very different ways--and with different motives.\nIn many countries, marriage is a practical matter. A marriage provides a safe and stable home for the husband and wife. It also joins two families, which benefits the couple's parents and makes them happy. Marriage also brings children, making sure the couple will be taken care of in old age. Because marriage is important for the whole family, some cultures don't let young people choose whom to marry.\nJust as there are many different reasons for marriage, there are also many different wedding _ . Every culture has its own ways of bringing good luck to the happy couple. In a typical Western wedding, the bride seeks good luck by wearing \"something old, something new, something borrowed and something blue.\" Something old represents the past. Something new represents success in the future. Something borrowed reminds the bride she can get help from her friends and family. And something blue reminds her to be true to her husband.\nIn Poland, one wedding tradition is not only lucky, but also very practical. The wedding guests pin money to the bride's dress while she is dancing. The money is meant to bring luck and to help the young couple build their new life. In Bermuda, the young couple plant a tree in the yard of their new home. Once they move in, they take good care of the tree and make it grow.

Converted to a standard match of 90 minutes, each referee made almost 23 mistakes, a remarkably high number.\nThe researcher then studied the videotapes to analyse the matches in detail.

Correct decisions came when the referees were moving at a speed of about 2 meters per second. The average speed for errors was 4 meters per second.\nIf FIFA, football's international ruling body, wants to improve the standard of refereeing at the next World Cup, it should encourage referees to keep their eyes on the action from a distance, rather than rushing to keep up with the ball, the researcher argues.\nHe also says that FIFA's insistence that referees should retire at age 45 may be misguided.

The idea is that over time, plants that require particular climate and soil conditions come to live in the same places, and are frequently to be found together.

But are these associations, _ are real in the present, permanent?\nA great natural experiment took place on this planet between 25,000 and 10,000 years ago, when small changes in the earth's orbit caused great sheets of ice to spread from poles.

Now this is not considered cool in town and the word \"train-spotter\" in Britain is related to \"geek\" or \"nerd\" (someone who seems very ridiculous). But is this reputation really deserved?\nFirst of all, let's see what train-spotting is. It is said that there are some 100,000 train spotters in the UK. Exactly as the title suggests, they spot trains, that is, they stand in train stations, look at the number of each train that leaves and arrives and write it down. The eventual aim is to have seen every train in the country.\nBeing crazy about railways and trains is not modern and it dates back to 1804. As the number of trains grew and they got faster and faster, so did the interest in them grow? Is this any stranger than people who love cars?\nSo, what do you need to be a train-spotter? Well, all you really need is a pen or pencil and a notebook to write down the train numbers. Other equipment  includes hot tea in a thermos, a camera and some sandwiches for those long afternoons spent on train platforms when you don't want to risk the delights of railway station food.\nIt's interesting to note that despite the \"bad name\" of train-spotting, there have been famous railway lovers in history, such as Alfred Hitchcock, who filmed them regularly, especially The 39 Steps. There is evidence, too, that being a train-spotter is not necessarily a strange phenomenon in Britain.\nOne glance at the US train stations should be enough to convince you that train-spotters there are alive and well. In America, they try to call rail lovers \"train-fans\" and talk of \"train-fanning\". Don't let this fool you--these people are train spotters and there are a lot of them.

Medical treatment for these disabilities was unavailable. Advancements in medicine and social services have created a climate in which people with disabilities can expect to have such basic needs as food, shelter, and medical treatment. Unfortunately, these basics are often not available. Civil liberties such as the right to vote, marry, get an education, and gain employment have historically been denied on the basis of disability.\nIn recent decades, the disability rights movement has been organized to fight against these infringements(;)of civil rights. Congress responded by passing major legislation recognizing people with disabilities as a protected class under civil rights statutes.\nStill today, people with disabilities must fight to live their lives independently. It is estimated that more than half of qualified Americans with disabilities are unemployed, and a majority of those who do work are underemployed. About two-thirds live at or below the official poverty level.\nSignificant barriers, especially in transportation and public awareness, prevent disabled people from taking part in society.

Scientists have a name for this phenomenon: behavioral _ .\nYou've probably experienced this before: after spending enough time with another person, you might start to pick up on his or her behavior or speech habits. You might even start to develop your friend's habits without realizing it. There is a large body of literature concerning this sort of phenomenon, and it regularly happens for everything from body postures to accents to drink patterns. For example, one study found that young adults were more likely to drink their drink directly after their same-sex drinking partners, than for the two individuals to drink at their own paces.\nAnd the effect isn't limited to real-life face-to-face activities. Another study found that the same you-drink-then-I-drink pattern held even when watching a movie! In other words, people were more likely to take a drink of their drinks in a theater after watching the actors on the screen enjoy a drink. At least I don't feel so strange anymore, having picked up on Adam Carolla's \"good times\".\nNew research published today in the journalPLOS ONEindicates that the same sort of behavioral mimicry is responsible for social eating, at least among university-age women of normal weight. That's right: the young women were more likely to adjust their eating according to the eating pace of their same-sex dining companion.\nAs with most experiments, these results raise a whole new set of questions. Still, the finding that behavioral mimicry may at least partly account for eating behavior is important, and has real effects on health. The researchers note that \"as long as people don't fully recognize such important influences on intake, it will be difficult to make healthy food choices and keep a healthy diet, especially when people are exposed to the eating behavior of others\".", "question": "Which of the following is NOT an example of behavioral mimicry?", "choices": ["A boy eats his popcorn after watching the actor eat.", "A boy buys a Nike shirt when he finds his desk-mate has one.", "A girl unconsciously sits straight just as others do.", "A girl takes on the Yorkshire accent after a month's stay."], "answer": 1, "label": "MUL"}

Animals make thousands of proteins -- they're the main element in skin, hair, milk and meat. Since animals can make proteins easily, they're good candidates   for making protein drugs.\nResearchers have already made cows, sheep and goats produce protein drugs in their milk. But chickens are cheaper to take care of, need less room, and grow faster than these other animals. Those qualities could make chickens a better choice to become living drug factories, says Simon Lillico of the Roslin Institute near Edinburgh, Scotland.\nLillico and a team of researchers changed chickens' DNA -- the code that tells cells how to make proteins -- so that the birds' cells made two protein drugs. One drug can treat skin cancer, and the other treats a nerve disease called multiple sclerosis  .\nThe scientists changed the chickens' DNA so that the birds made these drugs only in their egg whites.

{"background": "Our love of music and appreciation of musical harmony is learnt and not based on natural ability, a new study by University of Melbourne researchers has found. The researchers said previous theories about how we appreciate music were based on the physical functions of sound, the ear itself and a born ability to hear harmony.\nThe study shows that musical harmony can be learnt, and it is a matter of training the brain to hear the sounds. So if you thought that the music of some foreign culture (or Jazz) sounded like the crying of cats, it's simply because you haven't learnt to listen by their rules.\nThe researchers used 66 volunteers with a range of musical training and tested their ability to hear combinations of notes  to determine if they found the combinations familiar or pleasing. They found that people needed to be familiar with combinations of notes. If they found the notes unfamiliar they also found the sound unpleasant. This finding put an end to centuries of theories claiming that physical functions of the ear determine what we find attractive.\nThe study found that trained musicians were much more sensitive to unpleasant notes than non-musicians. When they couldn't find the note, the musicians reported that the sounds were unpleasant, while non-musicians were much less sensitive. This shows the importance of training or nurturing  the brain to like particular sound of combinations of notes, like those found in jazz or rock.\nDepending on their training, a strange chord  sound was pleasant to some musicians, but very unpleasant to others. This showed us that even the ability to hear a musical note is learnt.\nTo confirm this finding, they trained 19 non-musicians to find the notes of a random selection of western chords. Not only did the participants' ability to hear notes improve rapidly, afterward they reported that the chords they had learnt sounded more pleasant -- regardless of how the chords were played.\nThe question of why some combinations of musical notes are heard as pleasant or unpleasant has long been debated. \"We have shown in this study that for music, beauty is in the brain of the beholder \", a researcher said.", "question": "What is the main idea of the passage?", "choices": ["Love of musical harmony can't be taught.", "Love of music is not natural but nurtured.", "Listening to music can improve your brain.", "You can be a musician without being trained."], "answer": 1, "label": "MUL"}

Expressive leaders are less concerned with the overall goals of the group than with providing emotional support to group members and attempting to minimize tension and conflict among them.\nInstrumental leaders are likely to have a rather secondary relationship to other group members. They give others and may discipline group members who inhibit  attainment of the group's goals. Expressive leaders develop a more personal or primary relationship to others in the group. They offer sympathy when someone experiences difficulties and try to solve problems that threaten to divide the group. As the difference between these two roles suggests, expressive leaders generally receive more personal affection from group members; instrumental leaders, if they are successful in promoting group goals, may enjoy a more distant respect.", "question": "In mentioning \"natural leaders\" in Line 4, the author is making the point that   _  .", "choices": ["few people qualify as \"natural leaders\"", "\"natural leaders\" share a similar set of characteristics", "there is no proof that \"natural leaders\" exist", "\"natural leaders\" are easily accepted by the members of a group"], "answer": 2, "label": "MUL"}

Unlike the other disciplines ,philosophy cannot be defined by what you study, because it is actually unlimited. Anything can be the subject matter of philosophy: art, history, law, language, literature, mathematics, medicine, psychology, religion, science, and values. Philosophy is one of the world's oldest subjects of study, and in fact, the other academic disciplines are directly related to philosophy. For this reason you get a Doctorate  of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in biochemistry, or computer science, or psychology.\nTwo broad sub-fields of philosophy are logic and the history of philosophy. Logic is the science of argument and critical thinking. It provides sound methods for distinguishing good from bad reasoning. The history of philosophy involves the study of major philosophers and periods in the development of philosophy.\nOf what use is philosophy? First it is useful in educational advancement. It is necessary for understanding other disciplines.  Only philosophy questions the nature of the concepts used in a discipline, and its relation to other disciplines. And through the study of philosophy, one develops sound methods of research and analysis that can be applied to any field.\nThere are a number of general uses of philosophy. It strengthens one's ability to solve problems, to communicate, to organize ideas and issues, to persuade, and to take what is the most important from a large quantity of data.These general uses are of great benefit in the career field, not necessarily for obtaining one's first job after graduation, but for preparing for positions of responsibility, management and leadership later on. It is very short-sighted after all, to take a course of studies only for the purpose of getting one's first job.

Experts say few little bears would survive and the stress could make many females unable to get pregnant.\nThe team of American and Canadian scientists spent six months studying bears,on the ground,from spotter planes and in the lab,using computer models.\nSome team members fear the result is even worse for the bears than what their report says. They say the Arctic is warming faster than anywhere in the world and much faster than their computer had been forecasting. Satellite observations have showed that the ice has decreased to an all-time low.\nHowever,not everyone in the scientific community believes that global warming is happening on such an alarming scale. Another investigation has found that polar bears are still being hunted by wealthy \"sportsmen\" who want their skins and heads. At least ten international companies offer bear-hunting trips.", "question": "Why will polar bears die out if there is not enough sea ice?", "choices": ["Because polar bears can't catch enough food without ice.", "Because polar bears eat ice when they feel thirsty.", "Because polar bears will be easily found by hunters without ice.", "Because most female bears are used to giving birth under ice."], "answer": 0, "label": "MUL"}
{"background": "Who doesn't love sitting beside a cosy fire on a cold winter's night ? Who doesn't love to watch flames   curling up a chimney? Fire is one of man's greatest friends, but also one of his greatest enemies. Many big fires are caused by carelessness. A lighted cigarette thrown out of a car or train window or a broken bottle lying on dry grass can start a fire. Sometimes, though, a fire can start on its own. Wet hay   can begin burning by itself. This is how it happens: the hay starts to rot   and begins to give off heat which is trapped inside it. Finally, it bursts into flames. That's why farmers cut and store   their hay when it's dry.\nFires have destroyed whole cities. In the 17th century, a small fire which began in a baker's shop burnt down nearly every building in London. Moscow was set on fire during the war against Napoleon. This fire continued burning for seven days. And, of course, in 64 A.D. a fire burnt Rome. Even today, in spite of modern fire-fighting methods, fire causes millions of pounds' worthy of damage each year both in our cities and in the countryside.

{"background": "If you are planning to learn a foreign language, here are some suggestions about language learning. I hope these suggestions can help improve your learning of a foreign language\nTry to set aside some time every day for your study when your brain is at the most time for receiving information. It's better to study for 30 minutes every day than for 3 hours once a week. If you can spare two or three hours a day, break them up into some periods to avoid brain getting tired.\nGo over each lesson several times, perhaps once in the morning, once in the evening and once several days later. Give your brain time to understand the material, but the break between periods of study shouldn't be too long, or you will forget most of what you've learned.\nMake sure you're comfortable with the bases of the language before learning the more advanced knowledge. Without full understanding of basic knowledge such as words pronunciation and spelling, you'll find it very difficult to learn more.\nSetting proper targets is a good way to encourage yourself. You could set yourself a time limit or aim for a certain level.\nOnce you have mastered the bases of the language, learn to apply them to the things that you're interested in. In this way you are more likely to remember the words, phrases and grammatical constructions you meet.\nYou will find that at times you're making rapid progress, while sometimes you seem to stand still or even go backwards. This is normal when learning a language, so don't be discouraged.\nMaking mistakes in a foreign language is nothing to worry about. What matters is getting your message across, not whether you use all the right words, tenses, cases, etc. If you cannot think of the exact words, try using other ones.", "question": "The break between periods of study shouldn't be too long, because   _  .", "choices": ["you will be unable to go over a lesson for several times", "you will be too tired to continue your study", "you will waste a lot of time for study", "you will forget what you are trying to learn easily"], "answer": 3, "label": "MUL"}

{"background": "No one is sure how the ancient Egyptians built the pyramids near Cairo. But a new study suggests they used a little rock'n'roll. Long-ago builders could have attached wooden poles to the stones and rolled them across the sand, the scientists say.\n\"Technically, I think what they're proposing is possible,\" physicist Daniel Bonn said.\nPeople have long puzzled over how the Egyptians moved such huge rocks. And there's no obvious answer. On average, each of the two million big stones weighed about as much as a large pickup truck. The Egyptians somehow moved the stone blocks to the pyramid site from about one kilometer away.\nThe most popular view is that Egyptian workers slid the blocks along smooth paths. Many scientists suspect wokers first would have put the blocks on sleds . Then they would have dragged them along paths. To make the work easier, workers may have lubricated the paths either with wet clay or with the fat from cattle. Bonn has now tested this idea by building small sleds and dragging heavy objects over sand.\nEvidence from the sand supports this idea. Researchers found small amounts of fat, as well as a large amount of stone and the remains of paths.\nHowever , physicist Joseph West think there might have been a simpler way , who led the new study . West said , \"I was inspired while watching a television program showing how sleds might have helped with pyramid construction . I thought , \"Why don't they just try rolling the things ? \" A square could be turned into a rough sort of wheel by attaching wooden poles to its sides , he realized .

Instead of waiting around for opportunities, simply take the initiative and create what we want!\"\nAfter this week, I asked for his personal e-mail address and sent him e-mail sharing my views and dreams. He kindly e-mailed back simple encouragement such as \"Keep thinking and playing bigger; it's much more fun that way. Love, Jack.\" Then I got occupied with other things in life and I stopped e-mail Jack.\nA year later, my dream gradually faded. I had this idea if I got back in touch with Jack. I e-mailed him again and again but got no response. As I sat down at my computer to check my e-mail for the fifth time in 15 minutes, an inspiration came like lighting: What was I doing? Was I waiting for the prize of life? I knew I needed to do something about all this waiting. I was going to write a book, which I would call \"Waiting for Jack\"!\nIt all sounded good, but then reality hit. Some nights I cried and wanted to give up. I wrote and rewrote. Even though I could feel the fear, I did it anyway.

{"background": "Homework can put you in a badmood , and that might actually be a good thing. Researchers from the University of Plymouth in England doubted whether mood might affect the way kids learn. To find out the answer, they did two experiments with children.\nThe first experiment tested 30 kids. Someshapes  were hidden inside a different, larger picture. The kids had to find the small shapes while sitting in a room with either cheerful or sad music playing in the background. To test their mood, the scientists asked the kids to point to one of five faces, from happy to sad. Children who listened to cheerful music tended to point to the smiley faces while the others pointed to the unhappy ones. The researchers found that sad kids took at least a second less to find the small shapes. They also found an average of three or four more shapes.\nIn the second experiment, 61 children watched one of two scenes from a film. One scene was happy, and the other was sad. Just like in the first experiment, kids who saw the sad scene acted better compared to the others.\nThe researchers guessed that feeling down makes people more likely to focus on a problem or difficult situation. Not all scientists agree with them, however. Other studies argued that maybe, that cheerful music in the first experimentdistracted   kids from finding shapes.\nWhile scientists work on finding out the answers, it still might be wise to choose when to do your tasks according to your mood.

Plastic's toughness and flexibility represented a revolution in materials science during the 1950s and '60s. Decades later, however, plastic's very durability   is raising questions about how appropriate it is for one-time products such as plastic bags, or short-lived consumer goods, used in the home for a few years and then cast into a landfill where they will degrade for centuries.

That makes shrilk low cost, and its mass production possible should it be used for products demanding a lot of material.\nWork on shrilk is continuing in the lab. The inventors said the material becomes flexible when wet, so they're exploring ways to use it in wet environments.
