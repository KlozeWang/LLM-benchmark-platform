Nowadays, more and more young people are fond of music that is played on their portable MP3 players. So this announcement attracted a lot of attention in both the producer and consumer sides.\n       MP3 allows the digital music in CDs to be made smaller to a tenth its size and still sounds great. MP3 songs are small enough to be traded online; they are made by the millions to the _ of record companies, which fear that everything ever released on disc will end up online for free. Traditional records and their sale may be greatly damaged by this new format of music, and for the music's sake, it is better conveyed in this new medium.\n       That's why the recording industry appealed to the court against little Diamond Multimedia when it started selling a portable MP3 player two years ago. Not only did Diamond win in court, but it also sold 100,000 Rios along the way. With half a dozen other companies racing to produce their own versions of the Rio for Christmas, what could the music industry do? They have no choice in their future, their success just depends on how they can deal with the new trend and cooperate with the electronics companies.\n       It couldn't ignore MP3, which has become the format of choice among new bands trying to advertise their pre-released songs. So the industry agreed on it on one condition: within 18 months, when a standard is adopted that allows piracy-protected music (free from being illegally copied) to be sold online, the electronics companies agree to make their players in line with it.

As for the term, homesickness or nostalgia wasn't invented until the 17th century. It was considered a disorder by a Swiss physician, who attributed soldiers' mental and physical discomfort to their longing to return home, \"nostos\" from Greek, and the accompanying pain, \"algos\".\nStudies in recent years, however, have shown that nostalgia may have some benefits to our mental health.

Many artists late in the last century were in search of a means to express their individuality. Modern dance was one of the ways some of these people sought to free their creative spirit. At the beginning there was no exacting technique, no foundation from which to build. In later years, trial, error and genius founded the techniques and the principles of the movement. Eventually, innovators   even drew from what they considered the dread ballet, but first they had to get rid of all that was academic so that the new could be discovered.

She believed movement should be as natural as the swaying of the trees and the rolling waves of the sea, and should be in harmony with the movements of the Earth. Her great contributions are in three areas.\nFirst, she began the expansion of the kinds of movement that could be used in dance. Before Duncan danced, ballet was the only type of dance performed in concert. In the ballet the feet and legs were emphasized, with virtuosity   shown by complex, codified positions and movements. Duncan performed dance by using her body in the freest possible way. Her dance stemmed from her soul and spirit. She was one of the pioneers who broke tradition so others might be able to develop the art.\nHer second contribution lies in dance costume. She rejected ballet shoes and stiff costumes. These were replaced with flowing Grecian   tunes, bare feet, and unbound hair. She believed in the natural body being allowed to move freely, and her dress displayed this ideal.\nHer third contribution was in the use of music.

Tobacco plants produce nicotine because it defends against insects that would otherwise eat the plants.\n              The butts are undoubtedly smelly. But birds are actually quite fond of smelly chemicals, such as those found in aromatic   plants. Some nest-building species regularly fill their nests with fresh aromatics, possibly because the chemicals are good for the immune system or the development of the chicks. Alternatively, the plant chemicals might act as insecticides.\n              In the study, researchers at the Autonomous University of Tlaxcala in Mexico set up heat traps, which attract harmful insects, in 55 nests around Mexico City. Some traps were lined with the stuff in smoked cigarette filters. The others were lined with the stuff from unsmoked cigarette filters, which did not contain nicotine and other smoking by-products. Whether the nest held eggs, chicks or nothing, the unsmoked cigarette traps collected more harmful insects, suggesting that it is the chemicals that drove harmful insects away.\n              In a second experiment, the researchers collected 28 house sparrow nests and 29 house finch   nests from Mexico City immediately after the chicks flew out for food. They found that the more smoked filter stuff filled a nest, the fewer harmful insects it had.\n              The missing piece of the puzzle is whether the reduced number of harmful insects in the nests actually provided any benefit to the chicks. It is also unclear if nicotine or another chemical found in cigarettes may have turned the harmful insects out of the nests.\n              If the results hold, then this study is an example of wildlife adaptation to urbanization - or at least evidence that birds are smart and can still follow their noses in urban environments.", "question": "What may be the function of nicotine in cigarette butts for birds?", "choices": ["To provide building materials for bird nests.", "To drive harmful insects away from bird nests.", "To protect the plants from being eaten by insects.", "To attract baby birds to stay in the nests."], "answer": 1, "label": "MUL"}

Now, a new study reported online on April 2nd in Current Biology shows that jackdaws--birds related to crows with eyes that appear similar to human eyes--can do the same.\n\"Jackdaws seem to recognize the eye's role in visual perception, or at the very least they are extremely sensitive to the way that human eyes are oriented ,\" said Auguste von Bayern, formerly of the University of Cambridge and now at the University of Oxford.\nWhen presented with a preferred food, hand-raised jackdaws took significantly longer to get the reward when a person was directing his eyes towards the food than when he was looking away, according to the research team led by Nathan Emery of the University of Cambridge and Queen Mary University of London. The birds hesitated only when the person was unfamiliar and thus potentially threatening.\nIn addition, the birds were able to interpret human communicative gestures, such as gaze alternation and pointing, to help them find hidden food, they found. The birds were unsuccessful in using unmoving cues, including eye gaze or head orientation.\nUnlike most birds, jackdaws' eyes have a dark pupil surrounded by a silvery white iris. The researchers said they believe jackdaws are probably sensitive to human eyes because, as in humans, eyes are an important means of communication for them. The hand-raised birds examined in the study may be even better than wild jackdaws at attending to human gaze and responding to the gestures of the people who have raised them.\nThe findings are particularly notable given that most other species investigated so far, including our closest  s the chimpanzee and \"man's best friend,\" the dog, are not particularly sensitive to eye orientation and eye gaze, von Bayern said. Rather, she continued, chimps and dogs seem to rely on other cues such as head or body orientation in determining the looking direction of others. The results suggest that birds may deserve more respect for their mental abilities. \n\"We may have understated the psychological world of birds,\" von Bayern said. \"Jackdaws, among many other birds, form pair ties for life and need to have much in common and work together with their partner, which requires an efficient way of communicating and sensitivity to their partner's viewpoint.\"", "question": "Why does the author refer to chimpanzees and dogs?", "choices": ["To suggest that they are much better at interpreting gaze alternation.", "To reflect how unique jackdaws are in being able to notice gaze orientation.", "To show that they communicate more frequently with humans than jackdaws.", "To make clear that they rely on other means in determining people's intention."], "answer": 1, "label": "MUL"}
{"background": "\"What is the most important thing you've done in your life?\" The question was put to me during a presentation I gave to a group of lawyers.\nThe answer came to me in an instant. It's not the one I gave, because the situation was not right. As a lawyer in the entertainment industry, I knew the audience wanted to hear some amusing stories about my work with well-known people, but here's the true answer:\nThe most important thing I've ever done occurred on October 8,1990. I began the day playing tennis with an old friend I hadn't seen for a while. Between points we talked about what had been happening in each other's lives. He and his wife had just had a baby boy, who was keeping them up at night.\nWhile we were playing, a car came screaming up the road toward the courts. It was my friend's father, who shouted to my friend that his baby had stopped breathing and was being rushed to the hospital. In a flash my friend was in the car and gone, disappearing in a cloud of dust.\nFor a moment I just stood there, paralyzed . Then I tried to figure out what I should do. Follow my friend to the hospital? There was nothing I could accomplish there, I convinced myself. My friend's son was in the care of doctors and nurses, and nothing I could do or say would affect the outcome. Be there for moral support? Well, maybe. But my friend and his wife both had large families, and I knew they'd be surrounded by relatives who would provide more than enough comfort and support, whatever happened. All I could do at the hospital, I decided, was to get in the way. Also, I had planned a full day with my family, who were waiting for me to get home. So I decided to head back to my house and check in my friend later.\nAs I started my car, I realized that my friend had left his truck and keys at the courts. I now faced another problem. I couldn't leave the keys in the truck. So I decided to go to the hospital and give him the keys.\nWhen I arrived, I was directed to a room where my friend and his wife were waiting. As I had thought, the room was filled with family members silently watching my friend comfort his wife. I went in and stood by the door, trying to decide what to do next. Soon a doctor appeared. He approached my friend and his wife, and in a quiet voice told them that their son had died.\nFor a long time the two held each other and cried, unaware of the rest of us standing around in pained silence. After they had calmed themselves, the doctor suggested they spend a few moments with their son.\nMy friend and his wife stood up and walked past their families. When they reached the door, my friend saw me standing in the corner. He came over and hugged me and started to cry. My friend's wife hugged me, too, and said , \"Thanks for being here.\"\nFor the rest of that morning, I sat in the emergency room of that hospital and watched my friend and his wife hold the body of their infant son, and say goodbye.\nIt's the most important thing I have ever done. The experience taught me two lessons.\nFirst: The most important thing I've ever done happened when I was completely helpless. None of the things I had learned in university, in three years of law school or in six years of legal practice were of any use in that situation. Something terrible was happening to people I cared about, and I was powerless to change the outcome. All I could do was standing by and watching it happen. And yet it was critical that I do just that--- just be there when someone needed me.\nSecond: The most important thing I've done almost didn't happen because of things I had learned in classroom and professional life. Law school taught me how to take a set of facts, break them down and organized them. These skills are critical for lawyers. When people come to us for help, they're often stressed out and depend on a lawyer to think logically. But while learning to think, I almost forget how to feel. Today I have no doubt that I should have leapt into my car without hesitation and followed my friend to the hospital.\nFrom that one experience I learned that the most important thing in life isn't the money you make, the status you attain or the honors you achieve.", "question": "Which of the following is conveyed in this story?", "choices": ["Family and relatives can not take the place of friends.", "More people are a great comfort when one is in trouble.", "It is best to be here when someone needs you.", "You can certainly help a friend if you want to."], "answer": 2, "label": "MUL"}

{"background": "There are two factors which determine an individual's intelligence. The first is the sort of brain he is born with. Human brains differ considerably, some being more capable than others. But no matter how good a brain he has to begin with, an individual will have a low order of intelligence unless he has opportunities to learn. So the second factor is what happens to the individual--the sort of environment in which he is reared  . If an individual is handicapped   environmentally, it is likely that his brain will fail to develop and he will never attain the level of intelligence of which he is capable.\nThe importance of environment in determining an individual's intelligence can be demonstrated by the case history of the identical twins, Peter and Mark X. Being identical, the twins had identical brains at birth, and their growth processes were the same. When the twins were three months old, their parents died, and they were placed in separate foster homes. Peter was reared by parents of low intelligence in an isolated community with poor educational opportunities. Mark was reared in the home of well-to-do parents who had been to college. He was read to as a child, sent to good schools, and given every opportunity to be stimulated intellectually. This environmental difference continued until the twins were in their late teens, when they were given tests to measure their intelligence. Mark's I.Q. was 125, twenty-five points higher than the average and fully forty points higher than his identical brother.

Make special note of application deadlines, as they can vary from late summer to late spring.\n4. Apply for as many scholarships as you are eligible for-several smaller scholarships can add up to a lot of money.\n*During the application process\n1. Read the supplementary materials that come with scholarship application forms to better understand the program's focus (community service, subject interest). Try to answer the questions with the focus area in mind.\n2. Answer questions as they are asked. Don't go off the topic.\n3. If there is a financial component to the application, make sure you get accurate and complete information from all appropriate sources to ensure your eligibility.\n4. Take your time. Write down everything you can think of for each question, then set the application aside for a day so you can look everything over again before you send it off.\n5.

{"background": "In a recent study, participants were asked to drink beer from either a straight-sided glass, or a curved \"beer glass\". People took about almost twice as long to finish when drinking alcohol from the straight-sided glass, compared with the curved glass. There was no difference in drinking rates from the glasses when the drink was nonalcoholic.\nPeople may drink their alcohol faster from curved glasses because it is more difficult to accurately judge the halfway point of these glasses, the researchers concluded. As a result, drinkers may be less able to measure how much they have consumed. \"People often talk of 'pacing themselves' when drinking alcohol as a means of controlling levels of drunkenness, but I think the important point to take from our research is that the ability to pace effectively may be compromised when drinking from certain types of glasses,\" said study researcher Angela Attwood of the University of Bristol's School of Experimental Psychology in the United Kingdom.\nIn another experiment, participants completed a computer task in which they were shown pictures of two glasses containing varying volumes of liquid, and asked to judge whether each glass was more, or less, than half-full. The researchers found people made greater errors in judging the halfway point of the curved glass.\n\"The participants who showed the greatest error in these judgments also tended to show the greatest changes in their drinking rates,\" the researchers said. \"The speed at which people drink alcohol influences their level of intoxication  , and the number of drinks they consume on an occasion.

{"background": "Advertisers tend to think big and perhaps this is why they're always getting criticism. Their critics seem to resent(...) them because they have a gift for self-promotion and because they have so much money to throw around. 'It's unjust,' they say, 'that this entirely unproductive industry (if we can call it that) should absorb millions of pounds each year. It only goes to show how much profit the big companies are making. Why don't they stop advertising and reduce the price of their goods? After all, it's the consumer who pays...'\nThe poor old consumer! He'd have to pay a great deal more if advertising didn't create mass markets for products. It is precisely because of the heavy advertising that consumer goods are so cheap. But we get the wrong idea if we think the only purpose of advertising is to sell goods. Another equally important function is to inform. A great deal of the knowledge we have about household goods comes largely from the advertisements we read. Advertisements introduce us to new products or remind us of the existence of ones we already know about. Supposing you wanted to buy a washing machine, it is more than likely you would obtain details regarding performance, price, etc., from an advertisement.\nLots of people pretend that they never read advertisements, but this claim may be seriously doubted. It is hardly possible not to read advertisements these days. And what fun they often are, too! Just think what a railway station or a newspaper would be like without advertisements. Would you enjoy gazing at a blank wall or reading railway byelaws  while waiting for a train? Would you like to read only closely printed columns of news in your daily paper? A cheerful, witty advertisement makes such a difference to a dull wall or a newspaper full of the daily ration  of disasters.\nWe must not forget, either, that advertising makes a positive contribution to our pockets. Newspapers, commercial radio and television companies could not survive without this source of revenue . The fact that we pay so little for our daily paper or can enjoy so many broadcast programs is due entirely to the money spent by advertisers. Just think what a newspaper would cost if we had to pay its full price!\nAnother thing we mustn't forget is the 'small ads.' which are in virtually every newspaper and magazine.  What a tremendously useful service they perform for the community! Just about anything can be accomplished through these columns. For instance, you can find a job, buy or sell a house, announce a birth, marriage or death in what used to be called the 'hatch(giving birth), match and dispatch' column but by far the most fascinating section is the personal or 'agony' column .

If they don't, and each does its own thing, the group might break apart. Group members would be forced to live alone. Then they'd have a harder time hunting and raising their young.\n    That's probably why a traveling wolf pack stopped and waited to let its slowly moving leader catch up. Similar social ties may have caused a captive elephant to save her friend from drowning. Selfish reasons certainly motivated the male fox, who wanted to keep playing.\nSometimes, though, animals go out of their way to do what's right, even when there's nothing in it for them. Nobody knows why. \" It might simply feel good to be kind, just as it does for humans,\"  says Bekoff.\n     If your friend wasn't nice to you, what would you do? Maybe you would just walk away. That's exactly what a wild red fox did when she was play-boxing with another fox. The larger fox, a male, began pushing too hard. The little female didn't like fighting. She ran away quickly.\n     \" He still wanted to play,\" says Marc Bekoff. So the male fox ran after his playmate, bowed down, and rolled over.

{"background": "Methods of training animals have changed greatly in recent years. Zoo keepers have always had problems getting the animals to leave their cages in order for the cages to be cleaned, and also training them to move indoors when appropriate. Another problem was that many of the large animals became _ and bored. In the last twenty years, scientists have done research on dolphins and whales, training them to obey commands. The scientists found they could get animals to obey by rewarding them with food and affection when they responded correctly.\nProper training allows the animals to receive the care they need. It was very difficult to get untrained animals, especially the larger ones, to stay still when they needed medical attention. Now they can be trained, on command, to remain still and even to allow blood samples to be taken and shots administered. All this is accomplished through positive reinforcement, without the use of any force. Affection training, as this process is called, has been used with great success on a wide variety of zoo animals. Animal behavior experts have taught zoo keepers to train bears, tigers, monkeys, and many other species to behave in a way that provides for better animal-keeper interaction. This training also keeps the animals from becoming bored and inactive.\nAlthough some people proclaim  that this training is inhumance and cruel to animals, results have shown that captive animals who previously were not doing well flourish under the new training procedures.", "question": "The word \"listless\" means   _  .", "choices": ["countless", "obedient", "inactive", "mysterious"], "answer": 2, "label": "MUL"}

{"background": "Anyone who has experienced the joy of driving through a rainstorm with the sunroof   open understands how airflow around the moving vehicles can keep him dry despite the exposure. Now a similar principle is being employed to create an umbrella that protects people from the rain using nothing more than an invisible air force field.\nAir Umbrella, developed by a Chinese company and recently funded by Kickstarter, uses forced air rather than fabric to create a protective canopy that keeps people from getting wet in the rain.\nIt's a clever concept and designers have done a good job of answering several questions about the product. For instance, the sound generated by the device is minimal, especially when compared to the pitter-patter of the falling rain. It can create a protective canopy wide enough for two people to fit under and it performs well even in the heavy rain. The air shield   can be cut through by high winds, but given that regular umbrellas typically fold over in similar windy conditions, the air umbrella is still an upgrade.\nA few concerns do remain, however. For instance, the battery life is only about 15-30 minutes depending on the model, so you'll still want to walk briskly to your next destination when it's raining. Also, while the air shield might keep the rain away from you, it's likely to splash all that blown-away water onto anyone else like a sprinkler  . So the device might draw the _ of anyone else walking with you, or any helpless bystanders.\nThere are currently three different types to choose from if you're interested in investing. Air Umbrella-A is the lightest model, and is apparently designed specifically for females, according to the Chinese developers. It is about 12 inches in length and weighs a little over a pound, and it runs for 15 minutes per charge.

A scientist with many years' experience, he started this type of research in the early 1990s when he heard about hundreds of athletic shoes washing up on the shores of the northwest coast of the United States. There were so many shoes that people were setting up _ to try and match left and right shoes to sell or wear.\nEbbesmeyer found out in his researches that the shoes -- about 60,000 in total -- fell into the ocean in a shipping accident. He phoned the shoe company and asked if they wanted the shoes back. As expected, the company told him that they didn't. Ebbesmeyer realized this could be a great experiment. If he learned when and where the shoes went into the water and tracked where they landed, he could learn a lot about the patterns of ocean currents.\nThe Pacific Northwest is one of the world's best areas for beachcombing  because winds and currents join here, and as a result, there is a group of serious beachcombers in the area. Ebbesmeyer got to know a lot of them and asked for their help in collecting information about where the shoes landed. In a year he collected reliable information on 1, 600 shoes. With this data, he and a colleague were able to test and improve a computer program designed to model ocean currents, and publish the findings of their study.\nAs the result of his work, Ebbesmeyer has become known as the scientist to call with questions about any unusual objects found floating in the ocean. He has even started an association of beachcombers and ocean experts, with 500 subscribers from West Africa to New Zealand. They have recorded all lost objects ranging from potatoes to golf gloves.", "question": "What is the purpose of the author in writing this passage?", "choices": ["To call people's attention to ocean pollution.", "To warn people of shipping safety in the ocean.", "To explain a unique way of studying ocean currents.", "To give tips on how to search for lost objects on the beach."], "answer": 2, "label": "MUL"}

On this Saturday,a man and his young son,who was probably about 7 years old,walked in with a small cat in a cardboard box. There was something wrong with the cat's left eye. But the man could not afford to pay for the cost of the medicine. He kept quiet for a while,and then he asked where the nearest animal shelter was. Hearing this,his son cried and started to argue with him. All of a sudden,an older woman who was sitting in the waiting room stood up,walked up to the counter,and told the man that she would pay for the cost. The man thanked her and the son got to keep a healthy cat.\nI always thought it was the right thing to help out a needy person,but I only saw people do acts of kindness on TV or in movies.

{"background": "Jogging has become the most popular individual sport in America. Many theories,even some mystical ones,have been advanced to explain the popularity of jogging. The plain truth is that jogging is a cheap,quick and efficient way to maintain (or achieve) physical fitness.\nThe most useful sort of exercise is exercise that develops the heart,lungs, and circulatory systems. If these systems are fit,the body is ready for almost any sport and for almost any sudden demand made by work or emergencies. One can train more specifically,as by developing strength for weight lifting or the ability to run straight ahead for short distances with great power as in football,but running trains your heart and lungs to deliver oxygen more efficiently to all parts of your body. It is worth doing that: this sort of exercise is the only kind that can reduce heart disease, the number one cause of death in America.\nOnly one sort of equipment is needed--a pair of good shoes. Physicians advise beginning joggers not to try to run in tennis or gym shoes. Many design advances have been made in only the last several years that make a pair of excellent running shoes indispensable if a runner wishes to develop as quickly as possible,with as little chance of injury as possible. A pair of good running shoes will have soft pads for absorbing shock, as well as slightly built-up heels and full heel cups that will give the knee and ankle more stability. A wise investment in good shoes will prevent blisters and the foot,ankle and knee injuries and will also enable the wearer to run on paved or soft surfaces. No other special equipment is needed; you can jog in any clothing you desire,even your street clothes.\nIt takes surprisingly little time to develop the ability to run. The American Jogging Association has a twelve-week program designed to move from a fifteen- minute walk (which almost anyone can manage who is in reasonable health) to a thirty-minute run.

At that moment, they thought, \"Young people are interested in pirate, but there is no such a chance for people to get together to share it. Why not have a day when everybody talks like a pirate?\" They decided to make September 19th the date. Since then, Baur and Summers have tried hard to promote Talk Like A Pirate Day.

In 2002, Baur and Summers sent a letter about their invented holiday to Dave Barry. This columnist really liked their idea. He promoted the holiday and made it known to more and more people. Now, it has really become an international holiday. On Talk Like A Pirate Day, you need to dress like a pirate. You should wear a big hat or maybe cover one of your eyes. You can pretend to be any kind of pirate that you can find in any story or movie.\nHaving fun and being relaxed are not the only best things about the holiday. Young people share the same interest and childhood dreams that day. That's why it is welcomed by so many people, especially young people.\nUnlike traditional holidays, International Talk Like A Pirate Day is a brand new holiday which is invented by the youth themselves and celebrated by themselves too.

This may help you understand different kinds of relationships, what makes each relationship special, and how to communicate in a positive way. \n    What makes a relationship healthy?\n    Communication and Sharing: The most important part of any healthy relationship between two people is being able to talk and listen to each other. You and the other person can find out what your common interests are. You can share your feelings with the other person and trust that he or she will be there to listen to you and support you. In healthy relationships, people don't lie. Communication is based on honesty and trust. By listening carefully and sharing your thoughts and feelings with other people, you show them that they play an important part in your life.\n    Respect and Trust: In healthy relationships, you learn to respect and trust important people in your life. Disagreements may still happen, but you learn to stay calm and talk about how you feel. Talking calmly helps you to understand the real reason for not getting along. It makes it much easier to figure out how to fix it. In healthy relationships, working through disagreements often makes the relationship stronger.

Geocachers log onto a website to find information about the location of a cache -- usually a waterproof plastic box containing small items such as toys and CDs -- along with a notebook where \"finders\" can enter comments and learn about the cache \"owner\", the person who created and hid the cache.

{"background": "Listening, really listening, can improve communication and build respect with others. Communication begins by listening and then suggesting that you hear what the person is saying.\nThis can be recognized by focus or eye contact, body language, and reflective listening.\nFocus (Eye Contact)--Focus means that you are looking directly at the person speaking and not looking off to one side or continuing to do something else. You are focused on what is being said; the speaker is the center of attention. Listening attentively is essential for positive communication.\nListening Without Interrupting--Does your body acknowledge  that you are listening? Use smiles, nods, and expressions of understanding to communicate to the speaker that you are listening. It is not necessary that you agree or disagree at this time. It is more important for the person speaking to know that his or her words are respected. This strengthens communication.\nReflective Listening--Reflective listening involves hearing the feelings and meanings of the speaker. It is a re-statement (in different words) of what the speaker said. You, in essence, mirror the words of the speaker and rephrase them back to the speaker, checking for accuracy of understanding. This process affirms the speaker, indicates a respect of the person, and shows that you understand the speaker's message. Through careful reflection of the speaker's words, you can make clear the message and build mutual  understanding.

{"background": "Is language, like food, a basic human need without which a child at a critical period of life can be starved and damaged? Judging from the experiment of Frederick in the thirteenth century, it may be. Hoping to discover what language a child would speak if he heard no mother tongue, he told the nurses to keep silent.\nAll the infants died before the first year. But clearly there was more than lack of language here. What was missing was mothering. Without good mothering, in the first year of life especially, the capacity to survive is seriously affected.\nToday no such severe lack exists as that ordered by Frederick. Nevertheless, some children are still backward in speaking. Most often the reason for this is that the mother is insensitive to the signals of the infant, whose brain is programmed to learn language rapidly. If there sensitive periods are neglected, the ideal time for acquiring skills passes and they might never be learned so easily again. A bird learns to sing and to fly at the right time, but the process is slow and hard once the critical stage has passed.\nExperts suggest that speech stages are reached in a fixed order and at a constant age, but there are cases where speech has started late in a child who eventually turns out to be of high IQ. At twelve weeks a baby smiles and makes vowel-like sounds; at twelve months they can speak simple words and understand simple commands; at eighteen months he has a vocabulary of three to five words. At three he knows about 1,000 words, which he can put into sentences, and at four his language differs from that of his parents in style rather than grammar.\nRecent evidence suggests that an infant is born with the capacity to speak. What is special about man's brain, compared with that of the monkey, is the complex system which enables a child to connect the sight and feel of, say, a toy-bear with the sound pattern \"toy bear\". And even more incredible is the young brain's ability to pick out an order in language from the mixture of sound around him, to analyze, to combine and recombine the parts of a language in new ways.\nBut speech has to be induced(,), and this depends on interaction between the mother and the child, where the mother recognizes the signals in the children's babbling ,grasping and smiling, and responds to them. Insensitivity of the mother to these signals dulls the interaction because the child gets discouraged and sends out only the obvious signals.

Different colours have different meanings. Generally, carnation means \"fascination and woman love\". Specifically, pink carnation means \"I'll never forget you\" and red carnation says \"I admire you\". But some carnations have very negative meanings. If you want to say goodbye to your girlfriend, you can send her a bunch of striped carnations or yellow ones, because it means \"Sorry I can't be with you. You disappointed me.\"\nRose is no doubt the best gift for girls in love. Basically, it relates to the love between men and women, but roses with different colours stand for different stages of love. Red rose is man's best friend when he wants to show his love to a girl. In the peak of his love, pink rose is more suitable because it means \"perfect happiness and please believe me\". While the love gets into trouble, yellow rose seems to be the best symbol. It means \"the decrease of love and jealousy\".\nThough you are free to choose any kind of flower as long as it is beautiful, I think this breif introduction can help you avoid making mistakes.

You should push with the ball of your foot, he says.\nLayer up--While it's still cool, wear layers of clothing, with clothing close to the body that breathes and outer layers that do not absorb water. Go for bright colors that increase your visibility .\nBe reasonable--If you are just starting out and aren't in good shape, don't sign up for a 50-kilometre ride. And while cycling is great exercise for people who want to get into shape, if your doctor advises you not to do tiring exercise, cycling shouldn't be your starting position, Werstine says. Walk to begin getting into shape and then graduate to cycling.\nFix the fit--If you develop lower back pain or numbness in your hands and fingers from cycling, it could be your bike isn't adjusted properly for your height. A good cycle shop can help you find the right height for the seat and handlebars, but if you have continuing problems, consider consulting a bike fit physiotherapist, Werstine says.\nBe mindful--You have to pay attention on the roads to vehicles, other cyclists and pedestrians .Consider taking a cycling safety course to practise your skills.

But perhaps learners don't need to worry about communicating with native speakers so much. Research shows that most of the English spoken in the world today is spoken between non-native speakers of the language. In fact, when we think about \"International English\", there is no such thing as a native or non-native speaker.\nHow important is it to understand these slang words and expressions? If you watch films or TV, chat online in English, then understanding slang can be very useful. But you probably won't see much slang in your English exam though. With over seven billion people living on our planet today, it's easy to think one person's actions won't make a difference, however, from personal experience, I can say: each of us is capable of making a difference, however small, to someone's life.", "question": "Based on the slang mentioned above, what is the meaning of \"I think you got me well wrong.\"?", "choices": ["I think you really hurt my feelings", "I think you totally misunderstood me", "I think you found the completely wrong person", "I think you completely brought the wrong thing"], "answer": 1, "label": "MUL"}

Doctors were worried it might increase side effects such as blood clots  in the heart and lungs, strokes, or heart attacks. There was no evidence of that in theLancet study, though the authors said it was possible they might have missed some of these incidents.\nFor people between 5 and 45, accidents are the second leading cause of death worldwide after AIDS, and about 600,000 injured patients bleed to death every year.

{"background": "Computer power is moving into the \"cloud\"--networks of data centres that use the Internet to supply all kinds of services, from e-mail and social networks to data storage and analysis.\nThe rise of cloud computing is rapid and causing huge changes in the tech industry. The old guard is suffering: this week's $67 billion merger   between Dell and EMC, makers of computers and storage devices respectively  , was a marriage forced by the rise of the cloud. Disruptive   newcomers are blooming: if Amazon's cloud-computing unit were a stand-alone public company, it would probably be worth almost as much as Dell and EMC combined.\nThe gains for customers have been equally dramatic. Compared with older IT systems, cloud computing is often much cheaper. It adds tremendous flexibility: firms that need more computing capacity no longer have to spend weeks adding new servers and installing software. In the cloud they can get hold of it in minutes. Their applications can be updated continually, rather than just every few months. Individual users can reach their e-mails, files and photos from any device. And cloud services also tend to be more secure, since providers know better than their customers how to protect their computing systems against hackers.\nBut cloud computing makes one problem worse. In the old IT world, once a firm or a consumer had decided on an operating system or database, it was difficult and costly to switch to another. In the cloud this \"lock-in\" is even worse. Cloud providers go to great lengths to make it easy to upload data. They accumulate huge amounts of complex information, which cannot easily be moved to an alternative provider.\nCloud firms also create a world of interconnected services, software and devices, which is convenient but only for as long as you don't venture   outside their universe. Being locked in to a provider is risky. Firms can start to tighten the screws by increasing prices. If a cloud provider goes bust  , its customers may have trouble getting back their data.\nThese risks have already caused a debate about whether the cloud needs stricter regulation. Some European politicians want to force cloud providers to ensure that data can be moved between them. That is too heavy-handed, because strict rules will inhibit   innovation in what is still a young industry. The history of computing suggests that common standards may well appear naturally in response to customers' demands--just as in personal computers, where it is now much easier to use the same files on different systems.\nIn the meantime, a few commonsense measures can reduce the risk of lock-in. Firms that use more than one cloud provider to host their data are less affected. So are those that keep their most important information in their own data centres. Consumers can take precautions, too. Some services are better than others at enabling users to move data between providers (Google does well on this score). Cloud computing promises its users many benefits, but don't mistake it for some sort of digital heaven.", "question": "The author takes \"the merger between Dell and EMC\" for example to show   _  .", "choices": ["the influence of cloud computing on computer and storage device makers", "the miserable sufferings of old computer companies", "the rapid development of new computer companies", "the interaction between old companies and newcomers"], "answer": 0, "label": "MUL"}

While there are several standards for organic foods, foods must be grown without the use of antibiotics ,growth hormones ,chemical things and so on. The leaves of plants are one of the best choices.\nOn the other hand, natural foods have no legal rules, and are not controlled by any law. The USDA does require that seller should list the parts of natural foods, but there are no official rules for the amount of natural parts a food must contain. A natural food is usually considered to contain less chemical things, though there is no way to keep an eye on the product.\nThe USDA has guidelines for organic production. When considering buying organic foods, you must take into consideration that the organic meat, eggs and milk products must come from animals that are given no antibiotics or growth hormones.\nDue to higher labor costs, organic products cost 40% to 120% more compared with their natural foods.

The interviews focused on the participants' psychological and emotional distress   (i.e.whether they were nervous, sad, etc.) and if they had experienced any stressful events that day.\n              The participants were also required to answer questions such as, \"How would you rate your relationship with your mother during the years when you were growing up?\" and \"How much time and attention did your mother give you when you needed it?\" The same questions were asked about fathers.\n              People who reported they had a good mother-child relationship reported three percent less psychological distress compared to those who reported a poor relationship, according to Mallers.

After the college announced last October that it would go co-educational, about half of the students protested and two filed a lawsuit, which they later dropped. \nThe students--33 men and 383 women--came to campus late last month.

First, they say, the government now requires schools to meet higher-than-ever achievement goals for students. If students don' t succeed, the school faces punishment. Second, many parents want their children to be able to get into the best colleges and universities. These parents believe homework is a way to ensure that students are learning as much as possible.\nPeople who favor homework argue that it can have many beneficial effects.

It can help develop their independent learning and responsible character traits .\nBut studies show that middle school students doing 60 to 90 minutes of homework a night are doing just as well in school as those doing more than 90 minutes. And homework can have negative effects. Homework can deny students access to leisure  activities that also teach important skills. For example, sports teams teach cooperation and leadership, in addition to helping kids stay physically active. Another problem with too much homework is that parents can get too involved. They can put too much pressure on their kids.\nSo what should be done? Good homework assignments in the proper amount will have positive effects.

There is also likely to be a shortage of teachers with the right skills, since the trend has been to teach food technology rather than practical cooking.

{"background": "There are hundreds of expressions of words using \"hand\" in the English language. Let us examine some of the expressions that use \"hand\".\nWe will get a hand in this way. \"To get a hand in\" is to begin a job, to begin to know something about it. When we learn completely, we will be able to do it hands down. If we do the job well, we may end up with the upper hand. On the other hand, if the situation gets out of hand, it is out of control.\nWe must consider another way of expressing phrase---- to hand it to someone. For example, I must hand it to you for understanding what we have discussed this far. You can also lend a hand to someone but without really giving up your hand. You lend a hand when you help someone. If someone is kind enough to lend us a hand then we surely do not want to bite the hand that feeds us. We do not want to repay his kindness by treating him badly.\nNow, we have a free hand to continue examining other \"hand\" expressions. It means you are free to act without getting permission from someone else.\nMaybe you can find a friend who wants to take a hand in our project. It would have to be someone who was interested in these expressions. Your friend may want to work hand in glove with us. That is good because that means he wants to work as closely with us as a glove covers the hand. Of course, there is a danger that he may look at our project and decide to take it in hand. That means he wants to tale it over. If that happens, we may throw up our hands because the situation seams hopeless.

{"background": "(China Daily,,)\nA winner of the 2011 L'Oreal-UNESCO For Women in Science Awards, Professor Vivian Wing-wah Yam says she could not have done it without the backing of her family. \nThe road to scientific discovery is tougher for women than for men and Professor Vivian Wing-wah Yam says she couldn't have succeeded without such a supportive family. The 47-year-old from Hong Kong University was one of five women scientists, from each continent, to receive the 2011 L'Oreal-UNESCO For Women in Science Awards at a ceremony on March 3, at UNESCO Headquarters in Paris. It is the 13th edition of the award since 1998.\nYam's long and fruitful research on solving the energy problem won her the prize for Asia and the Pacific. There are several renewable and sustainable  energy solutions, like solar power, which could provide an unlimited source of energy. Some problems must be resolved, however, such as the low efficiency of solar cells and their high supply costs. Yam and her colleagues hope to overcome these problems by developing and testing new photoactive  materials.\nShe became the third Chinese women scientist honored with the so-called \"woman's Nobel Prize\" award, after Professor Li Fanghua from the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2003, and Professor Ye Ruyu from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2004.\n\"People think chemists are bad guys, but we are the good guys,\" Yam said in a humorous aside before explaining her research project on photoactive materials in an earlier speech at L'Institut de France. For Yam, chemistry is science, but also an art. Amazed by the universe, nature and color1 in her childhood, Yam decided on a career in chemistry. \"One of the beauties of chemistry is the ability to create new molecules and chemical species. I have always associated chemists with artists, creating new things with innovative  ideas,\" Yam said.\nAs a mother of two daughters, 12 and 14, Yam said she is lucky to have been supported by her family. She was inspired as a child by her father, a professor in the Civil Engineering Faculty at Hong Kong University. Yam added her husband, Mak Shingtat, a PhD in chemistry, who accompanied Yam to the awards ceremony, was also fully supportive of her work. \"I can't imagine how my career could move on without his understanding and support,\" she said. \"I often stay late at night in the laboratory. He always waits for me outside.\"\nYam received her bachelor and PhD degrees from the University of Hong Kong (HKU). She taught at City Polytechnic of Hong Kong before joining HKU as a faculty member, and headed the chemistry department for two terms from 2000 to 2005. At 38, she was the youngest member elected to the Chinese Academy of Sciences. She is also a Fellow of TWAS, the Academy of Sciences for the Developing World, and was awarded the State Natural Science Award and the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) Centenary Medal. 2011 is the 100th anniversary of Marie Curie's second Nobel Prize, coinciding  with the International Year of Chemistry. Today, Curie is still a role model for women in science.\nAlthough the participation of women in science, is promoted by UNESCO, notably through L'Oreal-UNESCO, there are still too few women doing high-level science, says UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova. The latest UNESCO report shows less than 40 percent of countries provide girls and boys equal access to education.\nEach year, the L'Oreal-UNESCO For Women in Science Award _ 15 young women from all over the world, especially developing countries, to encourage and finance their studies. More than 200 young women scientists are currently supported. \"I do not think there is a difference between men and women in terms of their intellectual abilities and research capabilities ,\" Yam said. \"As long as one has the passion, dedication and determination to pursue research wholeheartedly, one can excel regardless of one's gender or background.\"\nYam said some young women, who require stability and security, often have to give up their research because of family pressures. \"The only way for women to succeed in science is to get the mental and material support from family and society. There is a day-care center at my university, and my husband and mother-in-law help a lot with the housework, so I am able to spend my time on research,\" she said. \"I have two young daughters, and it is too early to tell whether or not they want to pursue careers in science. But, I will encourage them to always defend their ideas. To remain determined, and to never be afraid of failure - this is the advice that they will need to succeed in realizing their dreams.\" \nYam also acknowledged her colleague's support, at the awards ceremony. \"This (award) not only recognizes me, but my colleagues and students and my country, China.\"", "question": "For Yam, her winning the award mainly thanks to  _  . www.jsgaokao.net", "choices": ["her hard work", "the co-work from her students.", "the help from her colleagues", "the support from her family"], "answer": 3, "label": "MUL"}

If seismometers  detect an earthquake, the Dart buoys  will determine what is happening to sea levels, and whether a big wave might be on the way. This information is then sent via satellite to a central location which can organize an alarm. Within 50 minutes of the Haiti earthquake, this system was able to issue an alarm to other countries in the Caribbean to say that a small tsunami had been caused to start, and that was unlikely to affect them.\nDr Bernard said, \"The first 30 minutes following the earthquake, we have to rely on education.\" The critical aspects of this are: do you feel the earthquake; do you see the ocean draw down; and do you hear that loud roar? If so, you should run for higher ground.\n\"But after the first few minutes, it's crucial that we have the technology--the measurements to avoid unnecessary evacuation and tell people when it is safe to return.\" Right now, there are 50 of these Dart buoys all over the globe--four of which are in the Caribbean.\nDr Bernard says that, with 75 to 100 buoys worldwide, this system could provide global tsunami warnings within one hour.\n\"That's for everywhere we know that tsunamis have happened.

It started to shift direction soon after construction because of poor foundation in addition to the loose layer of subsoil . At the beginning, it leaned to the southeast before the shaky foundation started to shift leaning towards the southwest. After the period of structural strengthening at the beginning of the 21stcentury, now the Leaning Tower of Pisa leans at an angle of 3.97 degrees.\nIn 1178, the shift in direction was observed for the first time when the construction had progressed further to the third floor. The tower was heavy for the three-meter foundation that was built on a weak area of land.\nFor compensating  the leaning position, the builders started to construct the upper floors with one side higher than the other one. This caused the tower to lean in the other direction. This unusual structure led to the tower being actually curved. In spite of these efforts, the tower kept on leaning.\nThe government of Italy started to plan prevention of the complete collapse of the tower in 1964. However, a request was put forward by the authorities to keep the leaning position because of the tourism industry of the region.\nAfter nearly two decades of careful planning by engineers, historians and mathematicians, the stabilization efforts for the Leaning Tower of Pisa started in 1990. The tower was closed for the general public and the people living nearby moved away. For reducing the total weight of the tower, its seven bells which represented the seven musical notes were removed.

{"background": "I have only once been in trouble with the law.The whole process of being arrested and taken to court was a rather unpleasant experience at the time, but it makes a good story now. What makes it rather disturbing was the arbitrary circumstances both of my arrest and my subsequent   fate in court.\nIt happened in February about twelve years ago.I had left school a couple of months before that and was not due to go to university until the following October.I was still living at home at the time.\nOne morning I was in Richmond, a suburb of London near where I lived.I was looking for a temporary job so that I could save up some money to go traveling.As it was a fine day and I was in no hurry, I was taking my time, looking in shop windows, strolling in the park, and sometimes just stopping and looking around me.It must have been this obvious aimlessness that led to my downfall.\nIt was about half past eleven when it happened.I was just walking out of the local library, having unsuccessfully sought employment there, when I saw a man walking across the road with the obvious intention of talking to me.I thought he was going to ask me the time.Instead, he said he was a police officer and he was arresting me.At first I thought it was some kind of joke\nBut then another policeman appeared, this time in uniform, and I was left in no doubt.\n'But what for?\" I asked\n'Wandering with intent to commit an arrestable offence,' he said.\n'What offence?' I asked\n'Theft,' he said\n'Theft of what?'I asked\n'Milk bottles,' he said, and with a perfectly straight face too!\n'Oh,' I said.\nIt turned out there had been a lot of petty thefts in the area, particularly that of stealing milk bottles from doorsteps.\nThen I made my big mistake.At the time I was nineteen, had long untidy hair, and regarded myself as pan of the sixties' 'youth counterculture'.As a result, I wanted to appear cool and unconcerned with the incident, so I said, 'How long have you been following me?  in the most casual and conversational tone I could manage.I thus appeared to them to be quite familiar with this sort of situation, and it confirmed them in their belief that I was a thoroughly disreputable   character.\nA few minutes later a police car arrived.\n'Get in the back,' they said.'Put your hands on the back of the front seat and don't move them.'\nThey got in on either side of me.It wasn't funny any more.\nAt the police station they questioned me for several hours.I continued to try to look worldly and familiar with the situation.When they asked me what I had been doing, I told them I'd been looking for a job.'Aha,' I could see them thinking, 'unemployed'.\nEventually, I was officially charged and told to report to Richmond Magistrates' Court the following Monday.Then they let me go.\nI wanted to conduct my own defense in court, but as soon as my father found out what had happened, he hired a very good solicitor  .We went along that Monday armed with all kinds of witnesses, including my English teacher from school as a character witness.But he was never called on to give evidence.My 'trial' didn't get that far.The magistrate   dismissed the case after fifteen minutes.1 was free.The poor police had never stood a chance.The solicitor even succeeded in getting costs awarded against the police.\nAnd so I do not have a criminal record.But what was most shocking at the time was the things my release from the charge so clearly depended on.I had the 'right' accent, respectable middle-class parents in court, reliable witnesses, and I could obviously afford a very good solicitor.Given the obscure nature of the charge.I feel sure that if I had come from a different background, and had really been unemployed, there is every chance that I would have been found guilty.While asking for costs to be awarded, my solicitor's case quite obviously revolved   around the fact that I had a 'brilliant academic record'.\nMeanwhile, just outside the courtroom, one of the policemen who had arrested me was gloomily complaining to my mother that another youngster had been turned against the police. 'You could have been a bit more helpful when we arrested you,' he said to me reproachfully  .\nWhat did he mean? Probably that I should have looked outraged  and said something like, 'Look here, do you know who you're talking to?

Make sure you turn off electrical connections and gas immediately when an earthquake happens.\nDuring an earthquake, lie beneath an object that is not easily damaged. Do not go near objects that could directly fall on you. Never use the elevator to go down. Stay inside until the shaking stops and it is safe to go outside. Research has shown that most injuries happen when people inside buildings try to go out.

{"background": "Choosing the Right Resolution  \nMillions of Americans began 2014 with the same resolution they started 2013 with, a goal of losing weight. However, setting weight loss as a goal is a mistake.\nTo reach our goal of losing weight --- the output, we need to control what we eat --- the input ( ). That is, we tend to care about the output but not to control the input. This is a bad way to construce goals. The alternative is to focus your resolution on the input. Instead of resolving to lose weight, try an actionable resolution: \"I'll stop having desert for lunch,\" or \"I'll walk every day for 20 minutes.\" Creating a goal that focuses on a well-specified input will likely be more effective than concentrating on the outcome.\nRecently a new science behind incentives   , including in education, has been discussed. For example, researcher Roland Fryer wanted to see what works best in motivating children to do better in school. In some cases, he gave students incentives based on input, like reading certain books, while in others, the incentives were based on output, like results on exams. His main finding was that incentives increased achievement when based on input but had no effect on output. Fryer's conclusion was that the intensives for inputs might be more effective because do not knoe how to do better on exam, aside from general rules like \"study harder.\" Reading certain books, on the other hand, is a well-set task over which they have much more control.\nAs long as you have direct control over your goal, you have a much higher chance of success. And it's easier to start again if you fail, because you know exactly what you need to do.\nIf you want to cut down on your spending, a good goal would be making morning coffee at home instead of going to a cafe, for example. This is a well-specified action-based goal for which you can measure your success easily. Spending less money isn't a goal because it's too general. Similarly, if you want to spend more time with your family, don't stop with this general wish.

Thus, the atomic bomb was born.

{"background": "Children start out as natural scientists, eager to look into the world around them. Helping them enjoy science can be easy; there is no need for a lot of scientific terms or expensive lab equipment. You only have to share your children's curiosity. Firstly, listen to their questions. I once visited a classroom of seven -year- olds to talk about science as a job. The children asked me \"textbook questions\" about schooling, salary and whether I liked my job. When I finished answering, we sat facing one another in science. Finally I said,\" Now that we've finished with your lists, do you have questions of your own about science?\"\nAfter a long pause, a boy raised his hand, \"have you ever seen a grasshopper eat? When I try eating leaves like that, I get a stomachache. Why?\"\nThis began a set of questions that lasted nearly two hours.\nSecondly, give them time to think. Studies over the past 30 years have shown that. After asking a question, adults typically wait only one second or less for an answer, no time for a child to think. When adults increase their \"wait time\" to three seconds or more, children give more logical, complete and creative answers.\nThirdly, watch your language. Once you have a child involved in a science discussion, don't jump in with \"That's right\" or \"very good\". These words work well when it comes to encouraging good behavior. But in talking about science, quick praise can signal that discussion is over. Instead, keep things going by saying, \"That's interesting\" or \"I'd never thought of it that way before', or coming up with more questions or ideas.\nNever push a child to \"think\". It doesn't make sense; children are always thinking, without your telling them to. What's more, this can turn a conversation into a performance. The child will try to find the answer you want, in as few words as possible, so that he will be a small target for your disagreement.\nLastly, show; don't tell. Real-life impressions of nature are far more impressive than any lesson children can learn from a book or a television program.

This only goes to show that most Balinese people are happy to be where they are and never worry.\nOne factor that contributes to this laidback lifestyle is the culture of close family ties in Bali. In the Balinese culture, support is always available. Balinese extended families are so tightly linked that all members usually live in the same block.\nBalinese culture is based on a form of this religion, which is called \"Hindu Darma\". This religion reached the island during the eleventh century. Most of the family customs and traditions as well as community lifestyles of the Balinese people are influenced by this. The religious influence even expands widely into the arts, which makes Bali distinct from the rest of Indonesia.\nIn spite of the fact that tourists flood to the island every year, Balinese people have managed to _ their culture. Almost every native of Bali is an artist in some form or another. Parents and villagers have passed on their skills to their children, who all seem to have inclinations   either to music, dance, painting, or decoration.\nAnother remarkable mark of the Balinese culture is the senses of ceremonies known as the Manusa Yadnya.

{"background": "Everything in China is negotiable, so goes the saying, reminding foreign travelers to be on guard and avoid being overcharged. Foreign tourists are often advised to learn some bargaining skills so that they can avoid paying high prices. Generally speaking, bargaining is an art and an important part of people's life in China.\nBut the younger generation is gradually losing interest and the ability to negotiate a better deal. With fatter wallets, young people who never experienced war or shortages seldom bother to spend 10 minutes at a roadside shop cutting the price of a cell phone cover by 1 yuan. Saving for a rainy day and making good use of every penny---values held dear by older generations---no longer seem necessary. Naturally, bargaining is out, in an increasingly rich society. In this sense, bargaining is a product of poverty.\nBut in many countries, where residents' incomes are much lower than those in China, bargaining is not popular at all. I can still remember my failed bargaining attempts in Africa and Indonesia, where vendor  looked at me in surprise when I sought something at half the price. They shook their heads and stopped the negotiation. Latter I was told by friends who had been staying there for years that bargaining was not part of local commercial culture.\nDuring the years when the planned economy changed into the market economy, it was difficult for ordinary buyers to get a full picture of the product prices at a time when travel was inconvenient, and information spread slowly, adding to the information asymmetry . Afraid of being overcharged by vendors, buyers turned to the old wisdom of bargaining whenever and wherever they could.\nNowadays, the popularity of e-commerce has improved pricing transparence  to the extreme. With the click of a mouse, all kinds of information on a product can be found, with users' comments helping new consumers make decisions. With such transparency, overpricing becomes less frequent and bargaining is not a necessity for shoppers. In this sense, reduced bargaining activity can be seen as a sign of China's progress toward a more mature economy.", "question": "In China, the younger generation is losing interest in bargaining as a result of   _  .", "choices": ["rising incomes", "an increasing number of products", "the value of saving for a raining day", "their fear of losing face"], "answer": 0, "label": "MUL"}

Study after study suggests that handwriting is important for brain development -- helping kids get fine motor skills and learn to express and create ideas. Yet the time devoted to teaching penmanship in most schools has shrunk to just one hour a week. Is it time to give up handwriting? Have a look at the link between the brain and penmanship, and you may get the answer.\nA test among students in grades 2, 4 and 6 found that they not only wrote faster by hand than by keyboard, but also created more ideas when composing essays with handwriting. And other research shows that the finger movements required to write by hand activate brain areas involved with thought, language, and short-term memory.\nA recent Indiana University study had one group of children practice writing letters by hand while a second group just looked at those letters. Then, both groups of kids entered a functional MRI   that scanned their brains as the researchers showed them the same letters. Researchers found that the brain activity in the first group was far more advanced and \"adult-like\".\nHandwriting also affects other people's way they think of adults and children. Several studies have shown that the same average essay will score much higher if written with good penmanship and much lower if written out in poor handwriting. These studies have also found that people judge the quality of a person's ideas based on his or her handwriting. And the consequences are real: On standardized tests with handwritten sections, like the SAT, all essay that is considered hard to recognize gets a big zero.\nStudies show that this isn't only an English-language phenomenon.

In countries where status is important, it is not advisable to invite people of different statuses to the same dinner party. Americans will often invite people to their homes.

In some countries there is a \"help yourself\" method of entertaining done in the home. This method does not work well when entertaining people whose culture teaches them to wait to be asked three times before accepting an offer of food. For example, a Chinese guest went hungry all the evening without eating though he was quite hungry because he was too shy to take food after only being asked to do so once. In another case, an American woman executive  was being entertained in London. After having the tea served, the American woman helped herself to cream and sugar rather than waiting to be served. The English hostess was upset by the thought that she was not serving quickly enough.\nAs a general rule, a small gift from your home country is OK. A gift that is tied to the particular interest of the person is especially good. Gifts for children are also well received. Be careful that the \"hometown\" gift you are bringing to Singapore is not made in Hong Kong.

{"background": "Attitude is an internal  state that influences the choices of personal action made by the individual . Some researchers consider that attitudes come from differences between beliefs and ideas; others believe that attitudes come from emotional states. Here, we focus on the effects of attitudes upon behavior, that is, upon the choices of action made by the individual.\nThe kinds of actions taken by human beings are obviously influenced greatly by attitudes. Whether one listens to classical music or rock, whether one obeys the speed limit while driving, whether one encourages one's husband or wife to express his or her own ideas-all are influenced by attitudes. These internal states are acquired  throughout life from situations one is faced with in the home, in the streets, and in the school.\nOf course, the course of action chosen by an individual in any situation will be largely determined by the particulars of that situation. An individual who has a strong attitude of obeying laws may drive too fast when he is in a hurry and no police cars in sight. A child who has a strong attitude of honesty may steal a penny when she thinks no one will notice. But the internal state which remains unchanged over a period of time, and which makes the individual behave regularly in a variety of situations, is what is meant by an attitude.\nAttitudes are learned in a variety of ways. They can result from single events, as when an attitude toward snakes is acquired by an experience in childhood at the sudden movement of a snake. They can result from the individual's experiences of success and pleasure, as when someone acquires a positive attitude toward doing crossword puzzles by being able to complete some of them. And frequently, they are learned by copying other people's behavior, as when a child learns how to behave toward foreigners by observing the actions of his parents. Regardless of these differences, there is something in common in the learning and modification  of attitudes.", "question": "Which of the following is TRUE about the learning of attitudes?", "choices": ["Attitudes are only learned through one's success.", "Attitudes learned in danger will last no more.", "Copying others' behavior is not a good idea.", "Attitudes can be learned from one's parents."], "answer": 3, "label": "MUL"}

Take measures, such as following up with a phone call a week or so after you apply. If you know someone at the company, check whether that person will put in a good word for you.\nINTERVIEWS --- If you've got plenty of interviews but no return calls or job offers, take a look at your interviewing skills.

People have not enough time with their family.\nIt is evident that the causes of this phenomenon are different.

Researchers from the University of Plymouth in England doubted whether mood might affect the way kids learn. To find out the answer, they did two experiments with children.\nThe first experiment tested 30 kids. Someshapes  were hidden inside a different, larger picture. The kids had to find the small shapes while sitting in a room with either cheerful or sad music playing in the background. To test their mood, the scientists asked the kids to point to one of five faces, from happy to sad. Children who listened to cheerful music tended to point to the smiley faces while the others pointed to the unhappy ones. The researchers found that sad kids took at least a second less to find the small shapes. They also found an average of three or four more shapes.\nIn the second experiment, 61 children watched one of two scenes from a film. One scene was happy, and the other was sad. Just like in the first experiment, kids who saw the sad scene acted better compared to the others.\nThe researchers guessed that feeling down makes people more likely to focus on a problem or difficult situation. Not all scientists agree with them, however. Other studies argued that maybe, that cheerful music in the first experimentdistracted   kids from finding shapes.\nWhile scientists work on finding out the answers, it still might be wise to choose when to do your tasks according to your mood.

For example, 10 students from the Cristo Rey Jesuit College Preparatory School of Houston were conducting experiments about microgravity and put their samples on the rocket.  \"I know that failure is a part of science, but I really feel sorry for my students,\" science teacher Greg Adragna told the Houston,  Chronicle .\nAstronauts at the ISS felt a more urgent disappointment, however.

However, setting weight loss as a goal is a mistake.\nTo reach our goal of losing weight --- the output, we need to control what we eat --- the input ( ). That is, we tend to care about the output but not to control the input. This is a bad way to construce goals. The alternative is to focus your resolution on the input. Instead of resolving to lose weight, try an actionable resolution: \"I'll stop having desert for lunch,\" or \"I'll walk every day for 20 minutes.\" Creating a goal that focuses on a well-specified input will likely be more effective than concentrating on the outcome.\nRecently a new science behind incentives   , including in education, has been discussed. For example, researcher Roland Fryer wanted to see what works best in motivating children to do better in school. In some cases, he gave students incentives based on input, like reading certain books, while in others, the incentives were based on output, like results on exams. His main finding was that incentives increased achievement when based on input but had no effect on output. Fryer's conclusion was that the intensives for inputs might be more effective because do not knoe how to do better on exam, aside from general rules like \"study harder.\" Reading certain books, on the other hand, is a well-set task over which they have much more control.\nAs long as you have direct control over your goal, you have a much higher chance of success.

{"background": "As teachers, most of us have been taught that tests are the best way to assess our students' learning and the effectiveness of our teaching. But when a student scores poorly on a test, how does he or she benefit? The student loses confidence and ends up feeling \"stupid\". I believe we can use tests to improve learning, not just check what our students have memorized. \nI recently attended a conference where the speaker, Thomas Guskey, challenged us to consider how we might change the culture of classroom testing. Guskey asked, \"What happens to these tests? What educational purpose do they serve?\" His point was that teachers typically grade test papers, give them back, and then move on. Students put their test papers away and never look at them again. Some students will even make a show of walking leisurely to the trash to crumple and toss their test papers into the bin. If a student feels like he or she studied hard for a test and still got a bad grade, he or she can become disheartened with the classroom cycle that consists of teaching and testing, teaching and testing. \nMany times, testing simply feels like a winning or losing game between students and their teachers. I'll never forget the day my son and I were discussing testing in one of his least favorite classes (and with his least favorite teacher) and he looked me square in the eyes and said, \"Mom, I refuse to play the game.\" My son was in honors classes, yet he felt this way! Would it be regarded as less of a game if students had a chance to retake the test, or work out where they'd gone wrong?\nThere is an argument for the exam as the final assessment: if students don't have the knowledge by the time they're tested, that's unfortunate, but it's time to move on -- there's only so much time to teach the material. \"What about surgeons  ? Do they 'test' their learning on a genuine patient?\" Guskey asked. \"Or do they get to check their learning on a dead body to make sure they've got it worked out?\" You wouldn't show a surgeon a heart bypass in a textbook and then send him or her straight into the operating room!\nBy moving on immediately after giving an exam, we're missing a valuable opportunity to teach our students exactly what they need to learn! Rather than a game in which students either win or lose, we can turn testing into a win-win classroom experience by giving students the opportunity to learn from their mistakes. We can change the culture in our classrooms by using tests as a tool to improve learning rather than marking the end of the learning process.", "question": "According to what Guskey said, the culture of classroom testing makes   _  .", "choices": ["teachers focus on students' mistakes", "students dissatisfied with their teachers", "students not take tests seriously at all", "teachers lose confidence in their students"], "answer": 2, "label": "MUL"}

And, of course, people are driving the same brands of Japanese or European cars, usually wearing the same kinds of clothing and the world's airlines are all flying the same aircraft, Boeings or Airbuses.\nWhat, therefore, is the purpose of foreign travel for people who are not on business? What do tourists hope to experience in a foreign country that they cannot experience at home? Why travel to foreign countries at all? The answer could be that people are very interested in the past. It is a nation's history that is its main attraction. Most of today's tourists travel overseas to find out what foreign countries and cultures used to be like, not what they are like today. The words \" _ \" are now part of the language of tourism, and it is the museums and works of art in many countries that are their main attractions.\nIf they are lucky--and have had sensible, strong governments--many countries also usually have at least a few beautiful places for tourists to visit.\nFinally there is perhaps a nation's greatest attraction: its people. A nation is not just its historical buildings, its works of art or beautiful places, it is also the people who live in it. This is why a country such as Thailand attracts millions of people every year. They come mainly because of the friendliness of the Thai people. It is why the Pacific Islands are also so popular.

No doubt these homes were well-built, but what these people have done is mix up the quality of material used in the house with the quality of the craftsmanship.\nHomes today could be built to last just as long as those old homes if people were willing or able to pay the price. For example, most people can no longer afford solid oak stairways, although they were once fairly common in older homes. Nor can they afford the high labor cost of employing a carpenter to build the stairway. Yet if someone can pay the high cost, there are still plenty of carpenters around able to make those stairways. And not only would these carpenters know how to build them, they would probably do a better job than carpenters of old.\nOne thing the modern carpenter has which enables him to do a better job is much more advanced tools. Such tools as laser beams and powerplanes help them lay out a house better and make more precision cuts on the wood. Also, it is not uncommon say more to find carpenters with college degrees and carpenters with a solid knowledge of mathematics, which would enable them to deal with more difficult house designs.\nThe problem of modern quality, then, really boils down to the problem of material, for the modern carpenter is just as able to produce craftsmanship as the carpenter of fifty years ago, but only if given proper material.", "question": "Compared to the carpenters in the past, modern carpenters are  _  .", "choices": ["more successful", "more learned", "more imaginative", "more hardworking"], "answer": 1, "label": "MUL"}

The news was so unexpected that it left us all shocked and upset. A female colleague burst into tears and cried piteously at her desk. Somehow we got through the day's work. The next day was the funeral.\nOur big boss stepped forward to deliver a eulogy and was soon in tears. She carried on, in Chinese of course, but at the end said in English: \"There will be no more deadlines for you in heaven.\" Next came a long-term colleague who also dissolved in tears but carried on with her speech despite being almost overcome by emotion. Then a close friend of the dead man paid tribute , weeping openly as he spoke. Sorrow is spreading. Me and women were now sobbing uncontrollably. Finally, the man's mother, supported between two women, addressed her son in his coffin. At one point, the mother almost collapsed and had to be held up. We were invited to step forward to each lay a white rose on the casket. Our dead colleague looked as if he was taking a nap. At the end of the service I walked away from the funeral parlor stunned at the outpouring of emotion.\nIn the UK, families grieve privately and then try to hold it together and not break down at a funeral. Here in China it would seem that grieving is a public affair. It strikes me that it is more cathartic to cry your eyes out than try to keep it bottled up for fear of embarrassment, which is what many of us do in the West.\nAfterwards, a Chinese colleague told me that the lamenting at the funeral had been restrained  by Chinese standards. In some rural areas, she said, people used to be paid to mourn noisily. This struck me like something out of novel by Charles Dickens. But we have all seen on TV scenes of grief-stricken people in Gaza and the West Bank, in Afghanistan, Iraq and the relatives of victims of terrorist bombings around the world. Chinese grief is no different. I realized that it's the reserved British way of mourning that is out of step with the rest of the world.\nIt was our newspaper's production day. We were bussed back to the office to resume work. No more deadlines for our former colleague, but we had to pull together to put the newspaper to print.

But recent scientific studies have shown that plants communicate with each other and with other living things in a surprising number of ways. To understand them, scientists say, we just have to learn their language. Farmers are especially interested in what plants have to say.\n\"Plants are able to communicate with all sorts of organisms  . They can communicate with giant bacteria, with other plants and with insects. They do this chemically,\" said Cahill, an Ecology Professor of the University of Alberta in Canada.\nPlant scientists are just beginning to understand this chemical \"language\". Cahill says studies have shown, for example, that plants can evaluate   conditions in their immediate environment and take appropriate actions.  Plants have an ability, for example, to signal pain or discomfort caused by anything from temperature extremes to an insect attack. Jack Schultz, a professor of chemical ecology at the University of Missouri, says when a plant senses that it's being eaten, it cannot walk away from trouble; on the contrary, it will release a chemical vapor  that _ other plants nearby.\n\"Their language is a chemical language, and it involves chemicals that move through the air that are easy to be changeable, and most of all are smells that we are familiar with,\" Schultz explained.\n\"All plants responded to the attack by changing their chemistry to defend themselves,\" Schultz recalled. \"But we were quite surprised to find that nearby plants also changed their chemistry to defend themselves, even though they were not part of the experiment.\"\nStudies have also shown that plants under attack release pleasant chemicals. Those chemicals attract friendly insects that attack the pests eating the plant.\nIn the end, plants' ability to communicate their needs--and our ability to understand them--could help farmers reduce the use of poisonous chemicals, cut operating costs and limit damage to the environment.", "question": "Which would be the best title for the passage?", "choices": ["Communication between Plants", "A Chemical \"Language\"", "Plants Can Talk", "How Plants Protect Themselves"], "answer": 2, "label": "MUL"}

Where are those scissors, Janet?\" Sometimes his dad runs after him round the living room, pretending to cut off his ears. When he was young, David used to get too excited and start crying, scared that maybe he really would lose his ears, but he has long since grown out of that.\nMr Samuels' barbershop is in a long room above the chip shop, reached by a steep and worn flight of stairs. David follows his father. He loves the barbershop -- it's like nowhere else he goes. It smells of cigarettes and men and hair oil. Sometimes the smell of chips will climb the stairs along with a customer and when the door opens the waiting men lift their noses together. Black and white photographs of men with various out-of-fashion hairstyles hang above a picture rail at the end of the room, where two barber's chairs are fixed to the floor. They are heavy, old-fashioned chairs with foot pumps that screams as Mr Samuels adjusts the height of the seat. In front of the chairs are deep sinks with a showerhead and long metal pipe attached to the taps, not that anyone seems to use them. Behind the sinks are mirrors and on either side of these, shelves overflowing with all types of plastic combs, shaving mugs, scissors, cut throat razors, hair brushes and, 10 bright red bottles of Brylcreem , piled neatly in a pyramid. At the back of the room sit the customers, silent for most of the time, except when Mr Samuels breaks off from cutting and smoke his cigarette, sending a stream of grey-blue smoke like the tail of kite twisting into the air.\nWhen it is David's turn for a cut, Mr Samuels places a wooden board covered with a piece of red leather across the arms of the chair, so that the barber doesn't have to bend to cut the boy's hair. David scrambles up onto the bench.\n\"Hey, young man, you're shooting up, you won't need this soon, you'll be able to sit in the chair,\" the barber says.\n\"Wow,\" says David, turning round to look at his dad, forgetting that he can see him through the mirror. \"Dad, Mr Samuels said I could be sitting in the chair soon, not just on the board!\"\n\"So I hear,\" his father replies, not looking up from the paper. _ \n\"At least double the price,\" said Mr Samuels, winking at David.\nFinally David's dad looks up from his newspaper and glances into the mirror, seeing his son looking back at him.

All the men in the shop nod in agreement. David nods too.\nIn the mirror he sees a little head sticking out of a long nylon cape. Occasionally he steals glances at the barber as he works. He smells a mixture of smelly sweat and aftershave as the barber moves around him, combing and cutting, combing and cutting.\nDavid feels like he is in another world, noiseless except for the sound of the barber's shoes rubbing on the plastic carpet and the click of his scissors.

{"background": "Are you preparing for a big test? If so, you may want to play some basketball in between hitting the books. Doctors are starting to find more and more information that suggests a connection between exercise and brain development. Judy Cameron, a scientist at Oregon Health and Oregon Health and Science University, studies brain development. According to her research, it seems that exercise can make blood vessels , including those in the brain, stronger and more fully developed. Dr. Cameron claims this allows people who exercise to concentrate better. As she says, \"While we already know that exercise is good for the heart, exercise can really cause physical changes in the brain.\"\nThe effects of exercise on brain development can even be seen in babies. Babies who do activities that require a lot of movement and physical activity show greater brain development than babies who are less physically active. With babies, even a little movement can show big results. Margaret Barnes, a pediatrician , believes in the importance of exercise. She thinks that many learning disabilities that children have in elementary school or high school can be traced back to a lack of movement as babies. \"Babies need movement that stimulates their five senses. They need to establish a connection between motion and memory. In this way, as they get older, children will begin to associate physical activity with higher learning,\" says Margaret.\nOlder people can beef up their brains as well. Scientists from 11 universities studied a group of seniors ranging in age from seventy to seventy-nine. Their study showed a short-term memory increase of up to 40 percent after exercising just three hours a week. The exercise does not have to be very difficult, but it does have to increase the heart rate. Also, just like the motion for infants  , exercise for older people should involve some complexity. Learning some new skills or motions, such as with yoga or tai-chi, helps to open up memory paths in the brain that may not have been used for a long time.\nFor most people, any type of physical activity that increases the heart rate is helpful. The main goal is to increase the brain's flow of blood. And your brain can benefit from as little as three hours of exercise a week.", "question": "What is the best title of this passage?", "choices": ["How to exercise", "How exercise helps the brain", "How to get good scores on a test", "How the brain can change"], "answer": 1, "label": "MUL"}

{"background": "New research at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis shows that people who struggle with mood problems or addiction can safely quit smoking and that kicking the habit is associated with improved mental health. \n     Cavazos-Rehg, an assistant professor of psychiatry, found that quitting or significantly cutting back on cigarette smoking was linked to improved mental health outcomes. Quitting altogether or reducing by half the number of cigarettes smoked daily was associated with lower risk for mood disorders like depression, as well as a lower likelihood of alcohol and drug problems.\n     \"We don't know if their mental health improves first and then they are more motivated to quit smoking or if quitting smoking leads to an improvement in mental health,\" Cavazos-Rehg said. \"But either way, our findings show a strong link between quitting and a better psychiatric outlook.\"\n     In addition, she believes the serious health risks associated with smoking make it important for doctors to work with their patients to quit, regardless of other psychiatric problems.\n     \"About half of all smokers die from related to smoking, so we need to remember that as complicated as it can be to treat mental health issues, smoking cigarettes also causes very serious illnesses that can lead to death,\" she explained.\n     Cavazos-Rehg and her team analyzed questionnaires gathered as part of the National Epidemiologic Study on Alcohol and Related Conditions.

{"background": "What will higher education look like in 2050? That was the question addressed Tuesday night by Michael Crow, president of Arizona State University.\n\"We're at the end of the fourth wave of change in higher education,\" Crow began, arguing that research universities followed the initial establishment of higher education, public colleges, and land-grant schools in the timeline of America.\nIn less than a half-century, he said, global market competition will be at its fastest rates of change ever, with several multitrillion-dollar economies worldwide. According to a recent projection, the nation's population could reach 435 million, with a large percentage of those residents economically disadvantaged. In addition, climate change will be \"meaningfully uncontrollable\" in many parts of the world.\nThe everyday trends seen today, such as declining performance of students at all levels, particularly in math and science, and declining wages and employment among the less educated, will only continue, Crow maintained, and are, to say the least, not contributing to fulfilling the dream of climbing the social ladder mobility, quality of life, sustainable environment, and longer life spans that most Americans share.\n\"How is it that we can have these great research universities and have negative-trending outcomes?\" Crow said in a talk \"I hold the universities accountable. ... We are part of the problem.\"\nAmong the \"things that we do that make the things that we teach less learnable,\" Crow said, are the strict separation of disciplines, academic rigidity, and conservatism, the desire of universities to imitate schools at the top of the social ranks, and the lack of the computer system ability that would allow a large number of students to be educated for a small amount of money.\nSince 2002, when Crow started being in charge at Arizona State -- which he calls the \"new American university\" -- he has led more than three dozen initiatives that aim to make the school \"inclusive, scalable, fast, adaptive, challenge-focused, and willing to take risks.\"\nAmong those initiatives were a restructuring of the engineering and life sciences schools to create more linkages between disciplines; the launch of the School of Earth and Space Exploration and the School of Sustainability; the start of a Teachers College to address K-12 performance and increase the status of the Education Department at the university; and broadened access, increasing the freshman class size by 42 percent and the enrollment of students living below the poverty line by 500 percent.\nUniversities must start, Crow noted, \"by becoming self-reflective _ figuring out what we have and what we actually need instead of what legend tells us we have to be.\" Research universities today have \"run their course,\" he added. \"Now is the time for variety.\"\nDuring a discussion afterward, Crow clarified and expanded on some of his points. He discussed, for example, the school's distance-learning program. \"Nearly 40 percent of undergraduates are taking at least one course online,\" he said, which helps the school to keep costs down while advancing interactive learning technologies.\nHe said that Arizona State is working to increase the transfer and completion rates of community-college students, of whom only about 15 percent, historically, complete their later degrees. \"We've built a system that will allow them to track into universities,\" particularly where \"culturally complex barriers\" beyond finances limit even the most gifted students.", "question": "With the distance-learning program, Arizona State University is able to   _  .", "choices": ["enroll 40% of its students online", "keep costs down without a loss of quality", "provide an even greater number of courses", "attract the most gifted students all over the world"], "answer": 1, "label": "MUL"}

This letter is written to ask for your opinion.\n    The other day, I met with a multiple - choice exercise. We teachers argued heatedly with each other over its answer. Unfortunately, neither side could convince the other. The sentence is to be attached at the end of the letter. There is no doubt that the reference answer C is correct. But I don't  think it is the only answer. Personally, I do think A is also a reasonable choice in sense as well as in grammar, if the case is treated from another aspect.                                 \n    What puzzles me is why we should deal with so many multiple - choice exercises with not rigorous enough reference keys. But being a teacher, it's very important and necessary to make it clear to students which answer is correct, which is more appropriate, and which is the best one. Regrettably, Multiple - choice test, which is a bit old - fashioned in western countries, seems to be quite popular and covers a rather high percentage in all sorts of English tests in China, especially in NMET.\n    Personally speaking, I don't think multiple - choice test form making up more than 75 percent of the total scores in college entrance examination is a very good and effective testing method. Instead, more subjective testing forms depending on one's own thinking and his ability to use the language like key words falling, question answering, paragraph or passage summarizing, English - Chinese or Chinese - English inter - translation, etc. should be applied to English proficiency tests. Through the test forms mentioned above, students' ability to use the language will be better developed. Consequently, more advanced and outstanding English learners could be picked out. In fact, a test paper focusing on multiple - choice test influences, in a sense, students to form their own language thinking, which hinders the development of their language ability as well.

That is the statement of researchers who have found that tapping away on a mobile phone or computer keypad or checking for electronic messages temporarily knocks up to 10 points off the user's IQ. This rate of decline in intelligence compares unfavorably with the four-point drop in IQ associated with smoking marijuana, according to British researchers, who have described the phenomenon of improved stupidity as \"infomania\". The research conducted by Hewlett Packard, the technology company, has concluded that it is mainly a problem for adult workers, especially men.\nIt is concluded that too much use of modern technology can damage a person's mind. It can cause a constant distraction of \"always on\" technology when employees should be concentrating on what they are paid to do. Infomania means that they lose concentration as their minds remain fixed in an almost permanent state of readiness to react to technology instead of focusing on the task in hand. The report also added that, in a long term, the brain will be considerably shaped by what we do to it and by the experience of daily life. At a microcellular level, the complex networks of nerve cells that make up parts of the brain actually change in response to certain experiences.\nToo much use of modern technology can be damaging not only to a person's mind, but to their social relationship. 1100 adults were interviewed during the research.

Many rumours have been spread using such platforms. Since one cannot stop the culprits, users should always cross-check the news with news websites, and only then believe these. On platforms like Facebook, one should resist clicking on any links, because it can pass on your login and password details to the hackers. Besides, one should forward news links only after checking out from reputed news websites.\"\nSo, if you click on his so-called \"suicide video\", you could unwittingly install malware in your system through which the hacker can access your personal details like logins and passwords.\nAnkit Aggarwal, a resident of Tagore Nagar, said: \"I have also been a great fan of actor Rowan Atkinson, so the news of his death was quite shocking for me. The moment I read it, I shared the same on my wall. Later, through a friend, who had done her research well on the news, I got to know the news was false.

He can play catch and hit a ball as well as his son. A mother who has not thought about the words for years can teach her daughter the poem that begins \"Twinkle, twinkle, little star\" or remember the story of Cinderella or Goldilocks and the Three Bears.\nOne explanation is the law of overlearning, which can be stated as follows: Once we have learned something, additional learning trials increase the length of time we will remember it.\nIn childhood we usually continue to practice such skills as swimming, bicycle riding, and playing baseball long after we have learned them. We continue to listen to and remind ourselves of words such as \"Twinkle, twinkle, little star\" and childhood tales such as Cinderella and Goldilocks. We not only learn but overlearn.\nThe multiplication tables are an exception to the general rule. that we forget rather quickly the things that we learn in school, because they are another of the things we overlearn in childhood. The law of overlearning explains why cramming  for an examination, though it may result in a passing grade, is not a satisfactory way to learn a college course.

Call your doctor or local public health clinic before going in.\n3) Contain the illness-- Hand-washing works. Wash, wash and wash. Invest in some hand sanitizer   for the whole family. Avoid hugs and kisses of well-wishers, and do not share telephone handsets or computers. Be especially careful to always cough into the elbow of your arm (yes! the elbow, not your hand!). Cover your cough and sneeze to protect others. \n4) What about a mask?-- The data shows that masks do work --as long asthere is a tight seal   about the mouth and nose. \n5) Eat the pork(if you want) -- Swine flu gets its name because pigs can get the infection and spread it to each other -- as well as to humans. This latest virus contains pieces that indicate it evolved   from swine flu virus, and can now spread from person to person. Swine flu is not spread by properly prepared and cooked pork products.

In a world supposed to be moved by hunger and by love, Mrs. Packletide's movements were largely governed by dislike of Loona Bimberton.\nCircumstances proved favorable. Mrs. Packletide had offered a thousand rupees   for the opportunity of shooting a tiger without risk or effort, and it happened that an old tiger was frequently coming to a neighboring village at night. He was so old that he couldn't kill animals in the wild and just satisfied his appetite to the smaller household animals. The villagers were eager to earn the thousand rupees; children were posted night and day in the jungle to watch the tiger, and the cheap goats were left about to keep him from going elsewhere. The one great fear was that he should die of old age before the day of Mrs. Packletide's shoot.\nThe great night arrived. A platform had been built in a tree, on which sat Mrs. Packletide and her paid companion, Miss Mebbin. A goat with a loud bleat   was tied down at the correct distance. With an accurate gun, they waited for the coming of the tiger.\n\"I suppose we are in some danger?\" said Miss Mebbin.\nShe was not actually nervous about the wild beast, but she was unwilling to perform a bit more service than she had been paid for.\n\"It's a very old tiger. It couldn't spring up here even if it wanted to.\" said Mrs. Packletide.\nTheir conversation was cut short by the appearance of the old tiger. He saw the goat, and lay on the earth for a short rest before attacking.\nThe gun fired very loudly, and the great yellow beast jumped to one side and then rolled over in the stillness of death. In a moment a crowd of excited villagers appeared on the scene, and their shouting carried the glad news to the village.\nIt was Miss Mebbin who found that the goat was dying from a bullet-wound, while no wound could be found on the tiger. Evidently the wrong animal had been hit, and the tiger had died of heart-failure, caused by the sudden loud noise of the gun. Mrs. Packletide was annoyed at the discovery; but anyway, she owned a dead tiger, and the villagers, anxious for their thousand rupees, gladly accepted the fiction that she had shot the tiger. And Miss Mebbin was a paid companion. Therefore Mrs. Packletide faced the cameras with a light heart, and her pictures appeared on the newspapers of England and America. As for Loona Bimberton, she refused to look at a newspaper for weeks, and was in a depressed emotion for quite some time.\nMrs. Packletide's tiger-skin was inspected and admired by the neighbors, and Mrs. Packletide went to the Costume Ball in the character of Diana  .\n\"How amused everyone would be if they knew what really happened,\" said Miss Mebbin a few days after the ball.\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Mrs. Packletide quickly.\n\"How you shot the goat and frightened the tiger to death,\" said Miss Mebbin, with her unpleasant laugh.\n\"No one would believe it,\" said Mrs. Packletide, her face changing color1 rapidly.\n\"Loona Bimberton would,\" said Miss Mebbin.\nMrs. Packletide's face settled on greenish white. \"You surely wouldn't give me away?\" she asked.\n\"I've seen a weekend cottage near Dorking,\" said Miss Mebbin, \"six hundred and eighty.

Scientists have a name for this phenomenon: behavioral _ .\nYou've probably experienced this before: after spending enough time with another person, you might start to pick up on his or her behavior or speech habits. You might even start to develop your friend's habits without realizing it. There is a large body of literature concerning this sort of phenomenon, and it regularly happens for everything from body postures to accents to drink patterns. For example, one study found that young adults were more likely to drink their drink directly after their same-sex drinking partners, than for the two individuals to drink at their own paces.\nAnd the effect isn't limited to real-life face-to-face activities. Another study found that the same you-drink-then-I-drink pattern held even when watching a movie! In other words, people were more likely to take a drink of their drinks in a theater after watching the actors on the screen enjoy a drink. At least I don't feel so strange anymore, having picked up on Adam Carolla's \"good times\".\nNew research published today in the journalPLOS ONEindicates that the same sort of behavioral mimicry is responsible for social eating, at least among university-age women of normal weight. That's right: the young women were more likely to adjust their eating according to the eating pace of their same-sex dining companion.\nAs with most experiments, these results raise a whole new set of questions. Still, the finding that behavioral mimicry may at least partly account for eating behavior is important, and has real effects on health.

The idea seems absurd .\nYet I've had friends argue that plant intelligence might exist. \"What are the differences between plants and animals?\" they ask, and then they argue about certain species that seem to share the intelligence of both plants and animals. \nNew research suggests that plants communicate via \"networks\". Plant communication is not idea, and cannot indicate that it is a kind of intelligence, but it is still interesting.\nRecent research from Vidi researcher Josef Stuefer at the Radboud University Nijmegen shows that plants have their own chat systems that they can use to warn each other. Therefore plants are not boring and passive organisms that just stand there waiting to be cut down or eaten up. Many plants form internal communication networks and are able to exchange information networks and are able to exchange information efficiently.\nMany herbal plants such as strawberries and clovers  naturally form networks. Individual plants remain connected with each other for a certain period of time by means of runners (plant stems that grow along the ground and put down roots to form new plants). These connections enable the plants to share information with each other via internal channels. They are therefore very similar to computer networks. But what do plants chat to each other about?\nRecently Stuefer and hus colleagues were the first to prove that clover plants warn each other via the network links if danger is nearby. If one of the plants is attacked by caterpillars  , the other members of the network are warned via an internal signal. Once warned the intact  plants strengthen their chemical and mechanicaicl resistance so that they are less attractive to advancing  caterpillars. Thanks to this early warning system, the plants can stay one step ahead of their attackers. The research has shown that this significantly limits the damage to the plants.\nAgain, I don't believe this reflects intelligence,", "question": "What's the best title for the passage?", "choices": ["Does Plant Communication Really Exist?", "Some Discoveries About Clover Plant", "Does Plant Communication Imply Intelligence?", "A New Study on Plant Communication"], "answer": 2, "label": "MUL"}

And it also deactivates a gene that consumes fat,\" Zhao says.\n    Scientists have long believed that microscopic organisms in the gut, microbiota, may play a very important role in weight gain, but they had never been able to prove it.\n    In 2004, American microbiologist Jeffrey Gordon and his colleagues discovered a general link between obesity and gut microbiota in mice.\n    While a link was believed to exist, proving it was another matter.\n    \"The list of diseases that they may play a role in is just growing and growing,\" says Lita Proctor, director of the US National Institutes of Health. \"But the problem is that we're only able to look at associations and aren't yet able to conduct cause-and-effect studies.\"\n     In the clinical study, researchers found a growth of too much endotoxin-producing bacteria,\nleading t0 35 percent ofthe gut bacteria, in an obese patient whose initial weight was 175 kg.\n     Based on this information, researchers tried to cure the patient by feeding him a specialized\nnutritional liquid food to decrease the bacteria in his guts to ignorable amounts.\n     After 23 weeks, the patient lost 51.4 kg, with his fatty liver disease having almost disappeared.", "question": "What does the passage mainly talk about?", "choices": ["People's eating habits.", "Healthy lifestyles.", "A medical discovery.", "The consequence of obesity."], "answer": 2, "label": "MUL"}

He looked for the girl whose heart he knew, but whose face he didn't, the girl with the rose.\nHis interest in her had begun thirteen months before in a Florida library. Taking a book off the shelf he found himself intrigued, not with the words of the book, but with the notes penciled in the margin. The soft handwriting reflected a thoughtful soul and insightful mind. In the front of the book, he discovered the previous owner's name, Miss Hollis Maynell. With time and effort he located her address. She lived in New York City. He wrote her a letter introducing himself and inviting her to correspond. The next day he was shipped overseas for service in World War II.\nDuring the next year and one month the two grew to know each other through the mail. Each letter was a seed falling on a fertile heart. A romance was starting Blanchard requested a photograph, but she refused. She felt that if he really cared, it wouldn't matter what she looked like.\nWhen the day finally came for him to return from Europe, they scheduled their first meeting --7:00 PM at the Grand Central Station in New York. \"You'll recognize me,\" she wrote, \"by the red rose I'll be wearing on my lapel.\" So at 7:00 he was in the station looking for a girl whose heart he loved, but whose face he'd never seen.\nI'll let Mr. Blanchard tell you what happened: A young woman was coming toward me, her figure long and slim. Her blonde hair lay back in curls from her delicate ears; her eyes were blue as flowers. Her lips and chin had a gentle firmness, and in her pale green suit she was like springtime come alive. I stared at her, entirely forgetting to notice that she was not wearing a rose. As I moved, a small, attractive smile curved her lips. \"Going my way , sailor?\" she murmured.\nAlmost uncontrollably I made one step closer to her, and then I saw Hollis Maynell. She was standing almost directly behind the girl. A woman well past 40, she had graying hair tucked under a worn hat. She was more than plump, her thick-ankled feet thrust into low-heeled shoes. The girl in the green suit was walking quickly away. I felt as though I was split in two, so keen was my desire to follow her, and yet so deep was my longing for the woman whose spirit had truly companioned me and upheld my own.\nAnd there she stood. Her pale, plump face was gentle and sensible, her gray eyes had a warm and kindly twinkle. I did not hesitate. My fingers gripped the small worn blue leather copy of the book that was to identify me to her.\nThis would not be love, but it would be something precious, something perhaps even better than love, a friendship for which I had been and must ever be grateful. I squared my shoulders and saluted and held out the book to the woman, even though while I spoke I felt choked by the bitterness of my disappointment.  \"I'm Lieutenant John Blanchard, and you must be Miss Maynell. I am so glad you could meet me; may I take you to dinner?\"\nThe woman's face broadened into a tolerant smile. \"I don't know what this is about, son,\" she answered, \"but the young lady in the green suit who just went by, she begged me to wear this rose on my coat. And she said if you were to ask me out to dinner, I should go and tell you that she is waiting for you in the big restaurant across the street.

She took what the woman said as a sign that she should focus on the problem of hygiene , one of the most pressing needs for the homeless. \nAfter doing some research, Sandoval hit on the idea of a mobile unit that could be equipped with shower facilities. According to the company's founder Doniece Sandoval, every bus will be renewed and equipped with two separate private areas, each with a shower stall, sink, changing areas, toilet and bench. Sandoval says that if everyone sticks to a five-minute shower, a single Lava Mae bus could provide service for about 100 people during each 8- to 10-hour shift. \nThe project has been several years in the making as it has not been easy to get officials to agree. In addition, it is also difficult to ask the bus company to donate buses.
