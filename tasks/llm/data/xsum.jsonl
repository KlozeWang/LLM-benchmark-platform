{"question": "You may want to choose another fantasy destination after the British Foreign Office told tourists to be aware that some political demonstrations in the capital, Male, have led to violence. It did add, though, that most trips there are trouble-free.\nAt the end of last month the Maldives celebrated its birthday, 52 years since independence from Britain.\nBut the festivities were marred when the government ordered troops to storm the country's parliament and prevent opposition MPs from entering.\nIt was the latest dramatic attempt by President Abdulla Yameen to maintain his grip on power, and the latest twist in a tale of tropical intrigue worthy of a thriller.\nThe story is certainly set against a suitably exotic backdrop.\nThe Maldives is justifiably famous for its breathtakingly beautiful beaches and breathtakingly expensive luxury hotels.\nBut while the water of the coral reefs that surround them may be crystal clear, politics in the so-called \"island paradise\" has always been very murky indeed.\nThe political drama is centred, not on the beaches but on Male, the tiny, urbanised island where all of the Maldives' major institutions are based and which is one of the most densely populated cities on Earth.\nFor 30 years the country was a corrupt autocracy, ruled with the proverbial \"iron fist\" by Maumoon Abdul Gayoom.\nPresident Gayoom shrugged off numerous coup attempts during his three decades in power, but the wily tactician could not resist forever the growing demand for democratic reform.\nIn 2008, a charismatic young progressive, Mohamed Nasheed, swept to power in the country's first democratic elections.\nHe rolled back repressive laws, bolstered democratic institutions and captured the world's attention with an underwater cabinet meeting to highlight the risks of rising sea levels.\nBut the Maldives' brief moment as a model Islamic democracy was not to last.\nLess than four years later, Mr Nasheed resigned following a mutiny by the police and weeks of demonstrations after the arrest of the chief justice, something he now calls a coup.\nIn November 2013, Mr Yameen took office, but as he is Mr Gayoom's half-brother, it looked like a return to the old order.\nHowever, over the last year the two strongmen have had a spectacular falling out.\nSo much so that Mr Gayoom, the grizzled old dictator, has thrown in his lot with the dashing young democrat, Mr Nasheed.\nTo give you an idea of just how improbable this union is, you should know that Mr Nasheed was imprisoned and tortured during Mr Gayoom's rule.\nNevertheless these unlikely allies have prospered and - bolstered by defections from the ruling party - the opposition has managed to gain a small majority in the Maldivian parliament.\nThey had a plan - to stage a coup, but a democratic one.\nThey tabled a no-confidence vote against the speaker of the country's parliament.\nThe idea was to replace him and his deputy with opposition figures, who would lead an emergency government until elections early next year.\nIt looked likely to work, until, that is, Mr Yameen literally called in the troops.\nThey barred opposition MPs from entering parliament for the vote, thereby putting paid to the plotters' plans.\nSince then Mr Yameen has been trying to strip the opposition of its majority, arresting MPs and ruling that defectors must resign their seats.\nIt has been enough to allow him to cling on to power, for the moment at least.\nIf you are wondering why on earth you should care about this sun-soaked soap opera, you need to see the wider picture - because the Maldives is at the centre of a much bigger strategic power play.\nThe country's more than 1,000 islands stretch 800km (500 miles) into the Indian Ocean.\nThey straddle crucial sea-lanes, notably the busy but prosaically named bottleneck, the \"One and a Half Degree Channel\".\nIt makes the Maldives a pawn in the great game for regional influence being played out between India and China, the outcome of which may influence the shape of the world economy for years to come.\nBut there are more basic principles at stake here too - human rights and the rule of democracy.\nAnd they matter just as much in small nations with great beaches like the Maldives, as they do anywhere else in the world.", "answer": ["Are you dreaming of a holiday in the Maldives?"], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "There is almost nothing the new American president does not want to change - policy, tone, foreign relations, the press pool. Mr Trump has told his cabinet nominees to be bold and be bold now.\nHe wants a shake-up of US government and he wants it soon. That is why his first 100 days will be so definitive. He has set the timetable for an ambitious agenda and in the next three months we will find out how much he can really shift.\nThere is a lot happening in Europe also during this 100 days. Britain is beginning the formal process of Brexit and the Dutch will hold elections which could herald the next step in the transatlantic populist march.\nAnd of course, the French will gear up for their own election in which the National Front will be the focus of much attention. It is an extraordinary time on both sides of the Atlantic.\nThis exceptional moment demands examination and analysis. So the BBC is launching 100 Days, a daily programme that gives us the chance to look at these global shifts.\nIn many ways, the inauguration of Donald Trump marks the beginning of the test of the populist experiment. Now he owns the problems he campaigned against. Can his bold approach work, who will benefit and who won't and how will he engage with the rest of the world?\nEvery day for the next 100 days, with Christian Fraser in London and me in Washington, we will try to answer those questions.\nAs he left office, President Obama had a veiled warning for his successor - if you're going to try to change things and bring in bold ideas, make sure you're aware of the consequences. He also suggested that the weight of office would soon settle on Mr Trump's shoulders and cause him to look carefully and humbly at what he has taken on.\nMr Trump goes into the White House as the least popular incoming president on record. He won't like that. We know from his election campaign that he watches polls closely and however hard he tries to dismiss them as \"phony\" or \"lying,\" they matter to him.\nHis low ratings today give him a powerful incentive to do better. That could mean a combination of both working on his tone (something which appears to be unpopular with large sections of the American public) and pushing hard with his agenda (much of which also seems to be popular with many Americans). That too, will make this a fascinating time.\nSome of this is under Mr Trump's control, but some of it is not. The Republican Party will have a big impact in making his first 100 days successful - they can boost his legislative agenda or kill it.\nThe party owes Mr Trump a lot, he has just handed them Congress, the White House and the Supreme Court, that will win him a lot of favours. But many Conservatives do not agree with everything he wants to do and, if his poll numbers stay low, they will have less incentive to help him out.\nSo we have a busy, fascinating few months ahead of us. This populist trend is global and the test starts now. Mr Trump wants to change the look, feel and smell of Washington. Funny that, so did Mr Obama eight years ago.\n100 Days, presented by Katty Kay and Christian Fraser, Monday - Thursday at 19:00 GMT on BBC News Channel and BBC Four and BBC World News at 19:00 GMT.", "answer": ["Donald Trump has promised to take Washington by storm."], "label": "SUM"}

Perhaps one criticism that could be levelled at Aberdeen was how they had not managed to score before they did.\nThe breakthrough came from a set piece. Hayes floated a great free-kick to Taylor, whose header was equally accurate and found the corner.\nIncredibly, Hamilton were almost immediately handed a route back into the match.\nTaylor blundered to let Redmond in on Lewis, who appeared to hesitate, allowing the midfielder to nick the ball.\nThe goalkeeper got a touch on the ball, but it was not clear whether he had taken the man first. No matter, the referee gave the penalty, which Imrie fired home confidently.\nAberdeen responded well to that set-back, with Woods superbly tipping Taylor's drive over before Rooney appeared to be pushed in the box, but pleas were ignored.\nThe Dons went forward relentlessly. Manager Derek McInnes made a positive move, bringing on Maddison for Considine and it proved decisive.\nIt was Maddison's shot that Woods palmed back into play perfectly for the onrushing Rooney to net.\nMcMann prevented a third, hauling Hayes to the ground just outside the box that earned a red card with the winger in on goal.\nNo-one could realistically argue Aberdeen did not deserve the win. What is unclear is how they did not make it far more comfortable\nIt was a fourth successive defeat for Hamilton, albeit in a very tough run of fixtures. What will be more alarming for manager Martin Canning is the lack of wins in the last two months.\nAt times, the visitors were hanging on by a thread, struggling to contain the attacking threat they faced.\nThey had a fabulous chance for a second shortly before Rooney's goal and that would have made a huge difference.\nShay Logan gave possession away, Rakish Bingham surged clear and found Ali Crawford, but the midfielder could not get enough on his shot to beat Lewis while the goalkeeper was grounded. He should have scored.\nAberdeen manager Derek McInnes: \"We passed up so many opportunities. It was one-way traffic in the first half.\n\"By and large I felt we were on the wrong end of a few decisions today and I thought we still managed to thoroughly deserve three points.\n\"Reynolds scores a perfectly valid goal.

I felt it was inevitable that children would be abused.\"\nThree months after writing her letter she was told Lord Carey had been unable to consider her concerns because he was \"committed to a series of visits overseas, together with his summer break\".\nShe was informed one month later that the \"Archbishop had been assured that there was no question of Michael Walsh being reinstated in the choir,\" but nine months after raising her concerns she received a letter from the Archbishop's chief of staff confirming her abuser was back in the choir.\nLambeth Palace wrote to Ms Racine saying the parish authorities had taken \"great care\" in coming to their decision to allow Walsh's return to his position \"weighing carefully the risk of re-offending against... the Christian duty of forgiveness\".\nThe letters revealed Lord Carey regretted the decision which allowed Alesha's abuser back into churches and offered her his sympathies.\nMs Racine said: \"I thought his response was deeply hurtful, in that it had taken me a lot of courage to write to him at all.\n\"Most of what he said was in defence of the Church and the people in it, rather than try to reach out to me as a victim.\n\"I do feel it was a complete failure on his part.\"\nA spokesman for the former Archbishop of Canterbury said the correspondence with Ms Racine had been conducted on Lord Carey's behalf by his chief of staff.\nHe said: \"Lord Carey has absolutely no memory of this chain of correspondence or these events.

{"question": "Even organising matches is difficult. Visas are hard to come by and world football's governing body rules mean Tibet can only play other unrecognised teams.\nThe Tibetan football team is one of the main obstacles for China. They didn't like the Tibetan football team\nAfter five years without a game, the Tibetans - whose national team are nicknamed the Forbiddens - finally took to the field again when they competed in the 25th All India Shaheed Dal Bahadur Durgamal Mal Gold Cup, with teams from across India, Nepal and Bhutan.\nThe tournament took place in Dharamsala, Northern India, the current home of Tibet's spiritual leader the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan Government in exile. Fearing for his life, the 77-year-old was forced to flee Tibet in 1959 after years of violent conflict between Tibetan rebels and the Chinese army.\nThe Tibetan National Football Association was only set up in 2001. In that same year the team played its first match, a 4-1 loss to Greenland in Copenhagen.\nBut as Tibet's coach Kalsang Dhondup told the BBC's World Football programme, football is something the estimated 150,000 exiles feel very passionate about.\n\"Football was introduced by the British into Tibet in, I think, 1904,\" said Kalsang. \"Since then the Tibetans love football and physically the Tibetans are very much suited to football. Football is the most popular game in Tibet.\"\nIronically the British were in Tibet on a military expedition fearing Russia's growing influence in the region.\nBut now Tibet, in the north-east of the Himalayas, faces a very different problem. The football team encounters strong opposition from the Chinese who claim sovereignty over Tibet and dismiss any show of independence. But coach Kalsang remains defiant.\n\"The Tibetan football team is one of the main obstacles for China,\" he continued. \"They didn't like the Tibetan football team. But, whether they like us or not, we will play football.\"\nDuring the tournament in Dharamsala, the team wore black armbands to show their solidarity with Tibetans inside Tibet.\nSince 2009, 117 Tibetans have set themselves on fire to protest against the Chinese Government.\nTenzin plays for the Tibetans. He didn't want to give his family name because of fears for the safety of his relatives still in Tibet.\nHe admits that it's difficult to represent a country which is no longer recognised.\n\"I escaped from Tibet in 1996 and I feel very, very special and a lucky one to be part of the national team and it's really a proud moment for me,\" he said.\n\"Sometimes it's really challenging and difficult in such an environment where Fifa is not recognising our Tibetan football. At the same time I feel proud to represent Tibet and also feel responsible for the Tibetan cause.\"\nAnd, as Kalsang explains, the team have a big fan in the shape of the Dalai Lama.\n\"I think His Holiness has support for Tibetans in all issues,\" he stated. \"Even sport also. We went to Italy in 1999 and after we came from Italy we had an audience with His Holiness.\n\"At the end of that, when he had a ball in his hands, he said: 'I like football. When I was small there was no place for me to play football. If I play, the ball will fall from Potala (Palace) and then the ball will be lost.' He has a great support for us.\"\nOn the pitch things didn't go well for the Tibetans. They lost 3-0 against the Indian state team Himachal Pradesh.\nBut given the fact that past performances have included a 10-0 loss to Northern Cyprus and a 13-2 defeat at the hands of a Padania team from Northern Italy, perhaps that's not such a bad result.\nAnd for players, such as midfielder Sonam Topgyal, the chance to wear the Tibetan football jersey was a truly special moment.\n\"Right now I'm doing one job in a juice factory,\" Sonam explains. \"Since 2000 when I was in school I hear about the national team. Then I make a dream that one day I will represent the Tibet team.\n\"At that moment when we first stand on the field singing the national anthem, we really feel proud that we have a country and we are representing our country.\"\nAnd for players such as Sonam, their ambitions know no bounds.\n\"One day our Tibet will be free, so I wish I can represent Tibet in international competitions like the Olympics or World Cup,\" he concluded.\nYou can hear more about this story on the BBC World Service's World Football programme, which is available to download as a podcast.", "answer": ["Living in exile and playing for a team unrecognised by Fifa and opposed by the Chinese, means life isn't always easy for Tibet's footballers."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "MLAs have spent most of Tuesday debating the welfare reform bill, which has reached the consideration stage in Stormont's legislative process.\nThe day's proceedings adjourned at 22:00 GMT but will resume on Wednesday.\nWelfare reform had caused an impasse until a deal was reached at December's inter-party talks in Stormont House.\nPoliticians agreed to set aside tens of millions of pounds for a fund designed to provide financial support for those adversely impacted by welfare changes.\nMr Robinson said the financial cost of not implementing welfare reform would have been at such a level that \"we could not have sustained an executive\".\nHe said that other parties could not have an \"a la carte\" approach to the Stormont House Agreement.\n\"If people genuinely want to move forward in Northern Ireland, then it is important this legislation goes through. It's important that the parties uphold the agreement that all of us reached,\" he said.\nAt the start of the debate, the DUP was accused of \"killing off discussion\" of the bill.\nUlster Unionist Roy Beggs said the DUP had done so by  tabling a series of petitions of concern against amendments to the bill.\n\"They have displayed the undemocratic nature of their attitudes as MLAs and the undemocratic nature of their party, which of course has the word democracy in their name,\" he said.\nMr Robinson rejected Mr Beggs' claim that his party's actions were \"shameful\".\nThe measure was designed as a way to safeguard minority rights in Stormont's power-sharing assembly.\nIf a petition of concern is presented to the assembly speaker, any motion or amendment will need cross-community support.\nIn such cases, a vote on proposed legislation will only pass if supported by a weighted majority (60%) of members voting, including at least 40% of each of the nationalist and unionist designations present and voting.\nEffectively this means that, provided enough MLAs from a particular community agree, that community can exercise a veto over the assembly's decisions.\nApart from the amendments tabled by Social Development Minister Mervyn Storey of the DUP, only two others - put forward by the UUP - survived.\nHowever, Mr Robinson, the first minister, said assembly members were still capable of discussing the bill as well as the amendments.\nThe SDLP's Alex Attwood accused the DUP of trying to run a \"coach and horses\" through the amendments.\n\"Never before in the life of the chamber has there been such a swingeing attempt through petitions of concern to shut down what might be good law for the people of this part of the world,\" he said.\nSinn Féin's Martin McGuinness said some SDLP assembly members were defying their party leader Alasdair McDonnell by tabling the amendments in the chamber.\n\"The SDLP dissidents are clearly now in charge of the party and are prepared to risk the collapse of the Stormont House Agreement - and thereby the power-sharing institutions themselves - for the sake of party political grandstanding,\" he said.\nGenerally, Northern Ireland Assembly bills reach their consideration stage a few months after MLAs first debate their principles.\nThe fact that two years and four months have passed since this bill was last on the floor of the chamber shows just how difficult the arguments over welfare reform have been.\nHowever, the essential deal was struck before Christmas, with the parties accepting the introduction of universal credit and personal independence payments, to replace benefits such as jobseeker's allowance, tax credits and disability living allowance.\nStormont is providing support for those adversely impacted financially by the changes to the welfare system by setting aside nearly £30m to assist claimants who lose out in 2015/16.\nSinn Féin has claimed the fund will amount to more than £500m over the next six years.", "answer": ["First Minister Peter Robinson has told MLAs the Northern Ireland Assembly would have \"gone down\" if there had been no agreement on welfare reform."], "label": "SUM"}

But eight million children remain in the war-torn country, according to Unicef.\nIn eastern Aleppo, Save the Children estimates about 40% of the besieged population are children.\nWhile this means the recent casualty numbers it reported appear to be roughly proportionate with the population, it is out of step with what should be happening in a war zone.\nIn war, you should expect to see a much higher population of adult males being killed in frontline action, Ms Anning says.\n\"But what we have seen in Aleppo in the last couple of days is totally indiscriminate bombing from the air,\" she says. \"So children are impacted just as much or more than adults in those situations.\"\nThese tactics, combined with a continued siege preventing anyone from leaving the area, has created one of the worst situations for Syrian children in more than five years of war.\nWhen bombs rain down on densely populated urban areas like eastern Aleppo, there is nowhere to escape.\nAnd children are inherently vulnerable.\n\"They will often be playing outside, their movements will sometimes be less predictable, they may not instinctively run from danger,\" Hannah Stoddard, advocacy director for the War Child charity says.\nThis is compounded by the fact that school and hospitals, places where children are more likely to be present, are being targeted by the Syrian government.\nIn terms of injuries, children are also at greater risk. Blood loss is more devastating for them and fractures occur more easily.\nThe images of Alan Kurdi, Omran Daqneesh and now Rawan Alowsh might have captured fleeting global attention, but they are by no means exceptional cases that happened to be captured on film.\nRescue teams are finding children every day under piles of rubble.\n\"What pictures don't show is the mental scars that [these] children carry with them,\" says Ms Stoddard of War Child, which works with Syrian refugee children in Jordan.\n\"In the majority of cases, these children have lost one or more family members. They may be the sole survivor.\"\nAn immediate ceasefire is a prerequisite to any solution that could bring an end to the suffering of Aleppo's children, aid groups say.\nGiven the breakdown of a US and Russian brokered ceasefire last week and a spike in tensions between the two powers, the prospects for this appear slim.\nStill, if a ceasefire were to happen, sustained humanitarian access to all besieged areas could be possible, Ms Anning says.\nGroups need to be able to freely move in \"whatever aid is needed without preconditions, and evacuate medical casualties.\"", "answer": ["The haunting cries of five-year-old Rawan Alowsh, pulled alive from rubble in Aleppo by her ponytail, have reminded the world once again that behind the politics of Syria's civil war are millions of vulnerable children."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "Pensions have become increasingly difficult to understand, especially for those in final salary schemes and higher earners.\nThis Budget has added further traps for the unwary.\nAs expected, the amount that can be saved in a pension free of tax over the course of a lifetime is to be reduced from £1.25m to £1m from April 2016.\nIf your pension savings are more than £1m by that date, or you expect that what you have already saved will have grown to more than £1.25m by the time you take your pension, it is likely that you will be able to protect the funds you already have, as long as you do not put any more into the pension.\nThis is known as \"fixed protection\". HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) are expected to publish details of this shortly.\nThe amount that can be saved in a pension tax-free each year - the annual allowance - has been set at £40,000 since April 2014.\nThere will be changes to this system too.\nAt present, you can contribute up to £40,000 a year into a personal pension scheme.  If you have a \"defined contribution\" employer scheme, the total of employer and employee contributions must not exceed £40,000.\nThe position is more complicated if you have a final salary scheme. Each year you are in the scheme, the value of the pension you will receive on retirement increases.\nThe tax law assumes that you need a fund of 16 times that increase in order to pay the pension. So if you are a member of the pension scheme for a year, and your pension would go up by £2,000 as a result, tax law treats you as having increased your pension fund by £32,000.\nThis increase must not be more than £40,000, or you have to pay tax on the excess.\nHowever, if you have not used your annual allowances in previous years, you can carry forward the unused amounts from up to the last three years.\nUnder the new rules announced in the Budget, this £40,000 allowance will be reduced for those whose total income is above £150,000.\nIn working out whether your income is above £150,000, you need to include the value of any pension contributions you make, any pension contributions made by your employer, and the increase in value of any final salary scheme over the tax year. This is called \"adjusted income\".\nFor every £2 of adjusted income you have over £150,000, your annual allowance will be reduced by £1. The maximum reduction is £30,000, leaving an annual allowance of £10,000.  So once your income is over £210,000, there is no further reduction.\nIf you have unused annual allowances from earlier years, these can be carried forward in the usual way and added to your tapered annual allowance.\nIf your taxable income - after pension contributions and other reliefs - is £110,000 or less, then these rules will not apply.\nIn April, there was a major overhaul of pensions, allowing people to take out some of their pension in cash - possibly to buy cars or pay for holidays.\nIf you have taken money out of your pension using the new \"flexible access\" provisions, existing laws reduce your annual allowance to £10,000.\nSo you do not have a £40,000 annual allowance any more.\nThis does not mean that you escape these new tapering rules.  If you only have a £10,000 annual allowance, and your adjusted income is more than £150,000, the £10,000 allowance is tapered to zero.  If you have income of £210,000 and have flexibly accessed your pension, you therefore have a zero annual allowance.\nThe current pension regime gives tax relief when you put money into a pension. This pot grows largely tax-free, and you are taxed when you take it out, apart from a 25% tax free lump sum.\nIf your employer pays into the scheme, or funds a final salary pension, there is no employee or employer National Insurance Contributions (NICs) on the value of these payments or benefits.\nAmong the Budget papers is a consultation document which suggests replacing this long-standing system. Instead of tax and NICs relief on contributions, pension saving would be made out of after-tax income, as with the Individual Savings Account (Isa) system. When the money was taken out, it would be tax-free, under these proposals.\nThe Budget also announced the abolition of \"pension input periods\".  These are complicated but critical in setting how much tax relief you get on your pension contributions, and people can get caught out by getting their timing wrong.\nThe changes are highly technical. Before you make a contribution to your pension, you should find out whether they make a difference to your position.  The government have published some helpful examples to guide people.", "answer": ["This Budget not only chipped away at the pension tax regime, but also suggested that the entire edifice might be pulled down and replaced."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "But on the 100th anniversary of the 10 October 1911 rebellion that sprang from the Xinhai Revolution, which ended 2,000 years of imperial rule and ushered Chinese people into a modern era, mention of the ROC is rare - except in Taiwan.\nIn mainland China, the anniversary will be marked by mostly official activities that focus on the revolution and Sun Yat-sen, who inspired it, not the founding of the republic or Sun's principles of democracy.\nThat is because the Communist Party, which had nothing to do with the revolution, does not want to give much credit to the ROC and its founders, the Nationalists (or Kuomintang, KMT).\nThe two sides later fought a bloody civil war that ended with the Kuomintang fleeing to Taiwan in the late 1940s and re-establishing the republic there.\nBut in Taiwan, the government - currently led by the Kuomintang - is sparing no efforts to make sure the world does not forget the 100th birthday of the republic.\n\"It was the biggest event in China's 5,000-year history and a major change in political system which established the first republic in Asia,\" said the Kuomintang's historical archives director Shao Ming-huang.\n\"That planted the seeds of rebellion in Asia against foreign forces' control,\" he said, saying one of the reasons why Sun wanted to overthrow the Qing was because it was too weak to fend off foreign invasions.\nOn the island, the anniversary is being celebrated with much fanfare on Monday. A 40-minute fireworks show is planned in central Taiwan. Fireworks will also light up the skies in other areas, including Taipei.\nMany ordinary people watched the flag-raising ceremony in the morning and the subsequent activities, including a military parade involving more than 1,000 military personnel, 71 aircraft and 168 vehicles.\nNumerous couples got married in a mass wedding, and President Ma Ying-jeou made a speech. Even tourists were reminded - those arriving on Monday were presented with a centennial souvenir gift.\nBut on the eve of the anniversary, the legacy of the ROC is inevitably debated.\nSome people blame it for corruption and incompetence which led to it losing mainland China to the Communists in the civil war.\nAnd in Taiwan, a still significant segment of the population views the KMT and ROC with resentment because of suppressive rule after relocating to Taiwan in the 1940s.\nBeijing cautious on centenary\nIt is blamed for the 2/28 Incident in 1947 (an uprising sparked by the beating of a female vendor that lead to deadly riots) and a subsequent crackdown against dissidents known as the White Terror, which led to thousands of people being arrested, tortured, killed or persecuted. Martial law was not lifted until 1987.\n\"The ROC is a Chinese government exiled in Taipei. It should be out of Taiwan,\" said Tsay Ting-kuei, who is one of a group of people who believe that when Japan lost WWII, Taiwan technically should not have been handed over to the ROC because that was not specified in the treaties signed between Japan and the Western victors in the war.\nYeh Tsai-chu, a business woman, said she and her family will not be celebrating the anniversary - also known as Double Ten National Day.\n\"The ROC's 100th anniversary has nothing to do with Taiwan. Besides, what is there to celebrate? The ROC is not even recognised as a country by the rest of the world,\" Ms Yeh said.\nShe is referring to the fact that the ROC lost its seat in the United Nations in 1971 to the People's Republic of China.\nTaiwan's government and most people, however, strongly believe the ROC is a legitimate, sovereign country, despite claims to the contrary by China and only about 20 mostly small countries officially recognising it as such.\nAhead of the anniversary, passers-by expressed genuine pride in not only Taiwan but also the ROC. Many of them were descendants of long-time Taiwanese, not Chinese immigrants who came here after the war in the 1940s.\n\"It's done some good and bad, but it's mostly good. It raised Taiwan's living standards and the best thing is, it allowed Taiwan to become an open and free society,\" said Kevin Wun, 26, a financial risk manager.\nMany people also credit the ROC with saving Taiwan from a Communist takeover and helping the island become a prosperous economy and thriving democracy.\n\"What happened in the past has passed. Taiwan is the ROC, we've sung our national anthem for so many years. We're made up of longtime Taiwanese, more recent immigrants from China and South East Asian brides. We have such a free society today,\" said Chai-yun Lee, who is in her 60s.\nPressed for an answer, a Chinese tourist visiting Taiwan also agreed that perhaps the ROC's legacy may be more good than bad.\n\"We recognise Sun Yat-sen. We recognise the Xinhai Revolution, but not Double Ten National Day and not the ROC, but the ROC did more good than bad; it overthrew the emperors,\" said a Chinese woman who declined to be named.\nDespite the dark chapters in its history of rule in Taiwan, many Taiwanese people recognise the ROC as Taiwan, although they might define it differently from the ruling party.\n\"The ROC is Taiwan. It doesn't include the mainland,\" said Sidney Cheng.\n\"We're very proud of ourselves. Our country has a lot of great things, such as democracy, its high-tech industry, its economy and its friendly people.\"\nThe relevance of the ROC, however, could face threats in the future.\nMr Cheng and others noted when they travel abroad, people including customs officers are confused by what the ROC stands for, thinking it is China.\n\"When I went to Brazil, they stamped on my visa that I was Chinese,\" said Mr Cheng.\nMost people overseas know Taiwan as Taiwan, not the Republic of China.\nBut the KMT's chief historian Mr Shao insists the ROC's relevance will not diminish with time.\n\"The ROC not only achieved Dr Sun's ideals of nationalism, democracy and livelihood for the Chinese race [in Taiwan], things that have not been achieved by China, it will also play a very important role in eventually resolving the differences between Taiwan and mainland China,\" Mr Shao said.\n\"Even China has some feelings for it, because it was created by Sun Yat-sen and they respect Sun Yat-sen.\"\nBut the ROC's road to democracy is not complete.\nOn the eve of the centennial, an indigenous tribe in Taiwan vowed to carry out a symbolic headhunt of the ROC - to express frustration at its history of not respecting indigenous people's rights.\nBut such an activity would not be tolerated in mainland China, and such is the legacy of the ROC.", "answer": ["One of the most important events of the 20th Century was the overthrow of China's last imperial dynasty, the Qing, and the founding of the Republic of China (ROC)."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "The message from Celtic Park, in the wake of the announcement of Ronny Deila's exit at the end of the season, was one of calm and an insistence that they know what's gone wrong and they know what needs to happen in order to fix it.\nAs chief executive, Peter Lawwell has been caught in the fallout of Sunday's loss to Rangers in the Scottish Cup semi-final.\nThere have been calls for his head as well as Deila's, but Lawwell is probably less likely to leave now than he has been at any point in recent times.\nLawwell - and all people in his position - think about legacy. They all want to leave on a high, serenaded out on the back of a big feel-good moment. Lawwell is not likely to have Deila as the full-stop on his years at Parkhead, even though Deila was his appointment.\nThat's where the pressure comes, though. His next decision is a monumental one - and he'd better get it right.\nIf he doesn't then you wouldn't bank on him leaving on his own terms. If he does, and a winning manager is the result, then everything else fades away - all the supporter disaffection, all the issues about stockpiling players, all of it.\nThere were huge doubts swirling around Celtic Park in the dog-days of Tony Mowbray's reign but Neil Lennon took over and took things forward. Rangers could scarcely have been at a lower ebb than a 6-1 aggregate loss to a poor Motherwell side at the end of last season but Mark Warburton, in rapid time, turned it around.\nGood managers are like that. They have a touch of magic about them - they make other problems disappear.\nThe names of possible successors are coming thick and fast - David Moyes is, by the looks of it, fluttering his eyelashes at Aston Villa and Celtic. Lennon has made it clear that he would be happy to talk about a return. Malky Mackay has already let it be known that he would love the job.\nAlan Stubbs was considered a contender in the media a few months ago, then was written off when Hibs hit the wall, and might yet be a contender again if Hibs win the Scottish Cup and get promotion to the Premiership.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nNorthern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill has been mentioned. Roy Keane was offered the job before Deila and he's on the betting short-list again now.\nBefore this is done, there will be other names - many, many others.\nKeane's recollection of the summer of 2014 is interesting. It comes from his book, The Second Half. \"I got a call: would I go and have a chat with Dermot Desmond,\" Keane wrote about the time he was approached to succeed Lennon.\n\"At the end of the chat, [Desmond] said: \"The job is yours.' It was all pretty straightforward. There'd be one or two restrictions, about staff. They'd already picked the man who'd be my assistant, and they were insisting on him. It didn't scare me off, although it did get me thinking.\n\"It wasn't an ideal start. Were they doubting me already?\"\nOne lesson, of many, that needs to be learned is that the new manager should pick his own staff.\nKeane's story continued. \"Over the years, when chatting with people about football and Celtic, I'd always said, 'If you're offered the Celtic job, you don't turn it down'.\"\nWhen he started talking to Lawwell, though, Keane began to have doubts.\n\"I thought about the Celtic offer. It wasn't rocking my boat. They weren't convincing me - 'Listen, you're the man for us.'\"\nKeane concluded that had there been a bit of what he called \"give and take\", then it might have been different. \"Celtic didn't give me enough of a headache,\" he wrote. \"They just didn't show me that they wanted me.\"\nIt's a moot point about whether Keane would have been any good as Celtic manager, but if that's the manager Desmond wanted then the pursuit of him of was strangely lukewarm.\nThey ended up with a young and compliant manager, a worthwhile gamble but a punt that has led them to this point.\nCeltic's negotiations with their number one choice would need to be a whole lot more convincing this time around.\nThe situation that they're in now is not dissimilar to the one that Lennon inherited post-Mowbray. Against Rangers - and in too many matches preceding Sunday - Celtic looked like a team existing on reputation alone, tired champions vulnerable to the challenge of hungrier opponents.\nLawwell has been pelted with flak but this one is on Deila.\nCeltic have a battalion of players and, in relative terms, a lavishly assembled squad, but they were sent out on to the field in poor shape.\nThere is an argument - and it's hard to disagree with it - that if Warburton had switched hats, magic or otherwise, and was Celtic's manager, with all those players at his disposal, then the result would have been very different.\nWhen it comes to auditing Deila's time as Celtic manager the ledger is lopsided, the debits outweighing the credits to such a vast extent that the Norwegian could have no legitimate excuses when the announcement came.\nYou have to mine the records pretty thoroughly to find the marquee results on Deila's watch. In truth, there wasn't a single one that made you go 'Wow!' There were moments of optimism domestically, but that's a given when you're Celtic manager.\nIn Europe - what Celtic like to think of as their true testing ground - they have gone hurtling backwards.\nThere has been a haplessness in the transfer market that further undermined his position as Celtic manager. The hierarchy at the club have denied, on several occasion, that players were signed for Deila. They say that all players who came in did so with his approval. If that's the case then the charge sheet against him is a long one.\nCeltic have lost their way, that's obvious. They have given game-time to 34 players in the Premiership this season. Leicester's number, by comparison, is 23.\nNo side in the top three of any of the major leagues in Europe have used anything like Celtic's number in their domestic league. The average is 24.\nOf course, these clubs can afford to buy ready-made players, dependable talents who don't need to be developed. It's easy enough to operate with a smaller group of players if you're shelling out multiple millions on most of them.\nCeltic are supposed to be all about development. Fine.

{"question": "Three separate experts say Tata made the cash by selling carbon emissions permits it was given for free.\nThey say Tata was allocated more carbon allowances under the EU emissions trading scheme (EUETS) than it needed.\nThere is no suggestion Tata broke the rules, and the firm said its permits were a \"matter of public record\".\nReports say Tata profited more than any other firm in the UK from the much-criticised trading scheme, which allowed it to sell the surplus to other firms wanting permits to pollute.\nOther windfalls allegedly went to Lafarge, Hanson, and Total UK.\nBut the analysis is controversial because some climate sceptics blamed EU climate policies for the demise of Tata.\nOne report - by consultants CE Delft for citizens' group Carbon Market Watch - shows that the ailing steel firm was the UK's biggest beneficiary of the EUETS windfall, making £704m.\nOverall it says industry across Europe has earned a £19bn windfall from 2008 to 2014.\nTata declined to comment on the specific figures, but said it disagreed with the methodology used in the reports for calculating its profits from the EUETS.\nIt said the allegations were a \"selective telling of the many flaws in the EUETS.\"\nA spokesman told BBC News: \"We agree that the current emissions trading system needs to be fixed and all parties should focus on how best this can be done, rather than conducting theoretical studies on what it could have previously meant for individual companies.\"\nThe problem happened because when the EUETS began national governments were left to decide how many carbon permits their industries needed to cushion themselves from foreign competition.\nThe governments typically allocated more permits than necessary because it cost them nothing directly, whilst boosting domestic firms.\nThe sectors profiting most from pollution payouts have been iron and steel, cement, refineries and petrochemicals.\nOne report says the amount netted by industry over the period is more than 10 times the amount the EU has spent on innovation under the EUETS to make firms more energy efficient.\nI understand Tata is telling critics privately that it cannot be blamed for legitimately exploiting loopholes in a badly designed system.\nGreen groups say this is disingenuous as major European polluters lobbied governments to give them more emissions permits than they would really need. (Smaller firms not facing competitive global pressure had to buy all their emissions permits).\nThe EUETS has long been criticized for its failure to reduce carbon emissions, and citizens' groups are pressing for it to be reformed again.\nFemke de Jong, of Carbon Market Watch, said: \"Instead of making the polluter pay, energy-intensive companies are allowed to pollute for free under the EUETS.\n\"Even worse, they are able to profit from their pollution to the tune of billions. It's European taxpayers that are picking up this bill as governments forego scarce public money.\"\nEmil Dimantchev, carbon analyst from Thomson Reuters, estimates that Tata Steel is likely to have netted around £794m (€1bn) between 2008 and 2014 in windfall profits.\nDr Simon Evans, of Carbon Brief, calculated that across Europe Tata Steel made £1.4 billion from carbon allowances. His analysis criticises recent reporting of the steel crisis.\nTata Steel said: \"It is a matter of public record that on occasions we have been allocated more permits than we used.\n\"There are a number of reasons why in some years we haven't used all of our permits, which includes increasingly efficient production techniques and the impact of the global economic and steel industry crisis.\n\"The latter means that our volumes of production, and therefore emissions, have been well below what anyone forecast and in the main they continue to be so.\n\"However it is important to note that the situation changes on an annual basis, so in 2014 Port Talbot was under-allocated and this meant that we had to spend scarce resources on additional permits.\"\nBusiness Secretary Sajid Javid has said Tata Steel will begin the formal process to sell its loss-making UK plants by Monday.\nFollow Roger @Rharrabin", "answer": ["Tata Steel is refusing to comment on claims it has made £700m windfall profits from a policy designed to protect the climate."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "The agent, known by the alias Jack King, infiltrated a group of pro-German activists in south-east England in a previously unknown wartime operation.\nHis undercover work led to the identification of hundreds of people willing to pass secrets to the enemy.\nFiles in the National Archives describe King as a \"genius\" at his work.\nBy Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News\nWe had known that MI5 controlled German spies dropped into the UK under the Double Cross system but little was known about operations to control domestic sympathisers. This one began in a low-key manner with a correspondence club in which lonely people would write to each other but it would lead to the identification of potentially hundreds of people in Britain willing to help the Nazis.\nSince Britain was never invaded, it's impossible to know how the country would have actually reacted, but the files suggest there were at least a few hoping for Hitler to take over and actively offering assistance.\nThe role of the MI5 agent Jack King is also intriguing. Quite who he was seems something of a mystery but senior officials in MI5 clearly rated him highly for his ability over years to undertake risky work in reeling in more and more Nazi sympathisers by convincing them he was linked to the Gestapo - and doing so without ever getting too close to provoking them to do anything too damaging.\nIn 1942, King - also referred to as SR in the files - met Marita Perigoe, described as a \"crafty and dangerous woman\" of Swedish and German origin.\nDespite being married to a member of Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists, she had no time for the group and regarded them as \"insufficiently extreme\".\nMI5 said of her: \"She was found to be so violently anti-British and so anxious to do anything in her power to help the enemy that it was felt that special attention should be paid to her.\"\nIt went on to say she was not a \"neurotic nor feminine type; she is masterful and a somewhat masculine woman\".\n\"Both in appearance and mentality she can be described as an arrogant hun.\"\nKing managed to convince her that he was a representative of the Gestapo looking for people who were \"100% loyal to the Fatherland\" and could be relied on in the event of an invasion.\nHe exploited the group's taste for the cloak-and-dagger aspects of espionage work by offering them invisible ink for secret communications and arranging meetings in the basement of an antiques shop.\nMI5 regarded some members of the group as unstable but warned they were still dangerous.\nHilda Leech was \"unstable and neurotic\" and was trying to pass on reports of highly secret research on jet aircraft, while astrologer Edgar Whitehead  - a \"bit of a mystery man\" - was passing on information about secret trials on an amphibious tank.\nMI5 drew up plans to issue members with special badges to be worn in the event of an invasion - supposedly to identify them as friends to the Germans but in fact to enable them to be swiftly rounded up by the police.\nBy the end of the war, Perigoe was one of six agents working directly to King - all but one of them British.\nMI5 estimated the number of their contacts who had been the subject of King's intelligence reports ran \"certainly to scores and probably to hundreds\".\nIn other declassified files released by the National Archives, it emerged that English actor Michael Redgrave met Guy Burgess, one of the Cambridge spies, while his theatre group toured Moscow.\nThe meeting in 1958 with his old friend from Cambridge University proved to be of interest to MI5, which was desperate to find out all it could about what was said.\nBurgess, who had fled to Russia seven years earlier, turned up drunk at the theatre where Redgrave was starring in Hamlet.\nBut the two had lunch together the following day at Burgess' flat, provided by the KGB after his defection.\nThe British ambassador at the time said Redgrave had not been very communicative about the meeting and had not consulted the embassy about it beforehand.\nBurgess, however, wrote a letter home to his mother - intercepted by MI5 - delighting in the \"fine gossips\" shared and gushing over Redgrave's acting.\n\"It's certainly the best Hamlet I've ever seen - better than Gielgud, better than Olivier, much better than Paul Schofield.\"", "answer": ["An MI5 agent pretending to have Gestapo links secretly controlled a vast network of UK-based Nazi sympathisers, newly-released files reveal."], "label": "SUM"}

I felt I should have played far more than I did.\n\"Then it was all taken away from me. It kind of summed up my career. I got there and it got taken away from me.\n\"The best moment I have ever had in my life was one of the last days playing cricket for England, catching those catches in Joburg, winning that game with England, playing for your country amongst some great guys.\n\"It doesn't get much better than that. I achieved it, but I just did it less than I imagined and hoped.

{"question": "A new scheme called Flood Re has been designed to cut bills for those whose homes are in danger of flooding.\nUp to now, thousands of householders have been paying large additional premiums to make sure their homes and possessions are protected.\nAbout 350,000 homes could benefit - although thousands will be excluded.\nThe cost will ultimately fall on ordinary policy-holders, who will pay an extra Â£10.50 on their premiums on average.\nAs many as 15,000 homeowners made insurance claims for storm and flood damage last winter.\nInsurance companies should now be able to lower premiums, as they can pass on the flood risk element of policies to the reinsurer Flood Re.\nHouseholders who are eligible will also see their policy excesses - the amount they have to pay towards a claim - capped at Â£250. Previously, some people had to pay several thousand pounds towards repairs.\nHowever, houses built since 2009 will not be covered by the scheme. This was done to discourage developers from building on land at risk of flooding.\nBusinesses are also excluded, as are landlords who take out insurance policies on homes they do not occupy themselves.\nThe scheme has also been criticised by a group of climate change experts, who said it did not offer good value for money.\n\"It achieves very poor value for money because it is trying to subsidise the costs of flooding, rather than addressing the causes and trying to prevent flooding in the first place,\" said Daniel Johns, head of adaptation on the Climate Change Committee (CCC).\nInitially 17 insurance companies are taking part in the scheme.  If necessary, they can pass on any flood risk to Flood Re, which has been funded by the insurance industry as a whole.\nIts costs will be covered by an industry levy of Â£180m a year. Most insurance companies are expected to pass on that cost to their customers, raising average bills by around 2%.\nBut Brendan McCafferty, chief executive of Flood Re, said flood-risk consumers should benefit from greater choice and more competition.\n\"This should make flood cover more affordable and accessible to those in high flood risk areas over time,\" he said.\nHowever, consumers will not need to contact Flood Re directly, as this will be done by existing insurance companies.\nShira Kimmerling, whose home in Hebden Bridge was flooded on Boxing Day 2015, was previously unable to afford insurance.\nBut she told the BBC that, under the Flood Re scheme, she would now be able to pay for cover.\n\"I think it's wonderful news,\" she told the Today programme on Radio 4.\n\"But after all, it's not a very sustainable and cost-effective plan in the long term.

{"question": "Two separate trials of people accused of intending to supply nitrous oxide at music festivals were stopped after the courts heard the drug is exempt.\nThis now raises questions as to whether the new law will need to be amended.\nThe Psychoactive Substances Act was introduced last year to deal with the problem of new manufactured drugs.\nNitrous oxide, also known as laughing gas, is taken by hundreds of thousands of people every year as a recreational drug. But the gas is also used by doctors for its pain-relieving properties.\nA subsection of the Psychoactive Substances Act exempts medical products defined as \"restoring, correcting or modifying a physiological function by exerting a pharmacological, immunological or metabolic action\".\nA man was tried at Southwark Crown Court on Wednesday for intending to supply nitrous oxide at a music festival in Derbyshire.\nBut prosecuting barrister Adrian Fleming told the court that the Crown's own expert witness, Professor Philip Cowen, \"is expressing the firm view that nitrous oxide, as the legislation is currently worded, is an exempt substance\".\nMeanwhile a judge at Taunton Crown Court, where two people were on trial for intending to supply nitrous oxide at Glastonbury Festival, came to the same conclusion.\nIn that second case, Judge Paul Garlick said \"nitrous oxide is plainly capable of coming within the definition of an exempted substanceâ€¦ and in my view, on this evidence, it plainly is an exempted substance\".\nThe two court cases have prompted a full review of the legislation by the Crown Prosecution Service.\nThe Psychoactive Substances Act was designed to deal with a wave of new manufactured drugs, often called legal highs, by banning any substance which \"by stimulating or depressing the person's central nervous system... affects the person's mental functioning or emotional state\".\nThe law specifically exempts alcohol, tobacco or nicotine-based products, caffeine, food and drink and medicinal products as defined in the Human Medicines Regulations 2012.\nIt is that last exemption that led the case to collapse.\nThe drug charity, Release, has described the law as \"fundamentally flawed\".\nIts executive director, Niamh Eastwood, said: \"The CPS must urgently drop all prosecutions under the Psychoactive Substances Act and review cases where defendants have previously pleaded guilty.\"\nMr Fleming told Southwark Crown Court that \"Professor Cowen has expressed the clear view that nitrous oxide falls within the definition because of its analgesic effects\".\n\"That may not have been the intention of those who framed the act, but the subsection clearly covers nitrous oxide.\"\nThe judge, David Tomlinson, instructed the jury to find the defendant - who cannot be named for legal reasons - not guilty.\nStressing that the hearing was not a \"test case\" and offered no precedent, Judge Tomlinson said the not guilty verdict could mean that either there was \"a very lucky defendant or a number of other defendants will have their convictions quashed\".\nIt is understood about 50 people have pleaded guilty to supplying nitrous oxide under the legislation, but this is the first time a defendant has contested the charge. Some lawyers are suggesting other substances may also be affected by the case.\nMr Fleming said the CPS had told him the situation demanded \"a full review of the legislation and that will be carried out\".\nHome Office crime survey figures published last month suggest 840,000 people in England and Wales used nitrous oxide in 2016-17. The silver canisters are a common sight at music festivals.\nThe gas was not considered harmful enough to be designated a controlled substance under existing drugs laws. In the last 10 years there have been 19 deaths associated with nitrous oxide, although a number of those are understood to have been suicides.\nThe collapse of two cases against people accused of intending to supply nitrous oxide is an embarrassment for the government, which had hailed the act as the answer to dealing with legal highs.\nBut during its passage through Parliament, ministers were warned that the law may be unworkable.\nDrug experts say the big test of the legislation is whether lawyers can prove that a substance is \"psychoactive\".\nThe Home Office is pinning its hopes on a new scientific experiment conducted in a test tube. The technique is designed to demonstrate whether a product binds to a particular receptor in the human body, affecting mental functioning or emotional state.\nBut ministers have been warned that such laboratory tests cannot prove that a substance affects the brain in a way that makes it psychoactive under the act.\nSome experts believe the only sure way to demonstrate a substance is psychoactive is to scan the brain of a human as they take it, which is an impractical approach.\nA similar problem blunted legal-high legislation in the Republic of Ireland.", "answer": ["A law banning so-called legal highs in the UK is to be reviewed after the collapse of the first ever contested cases under the new legislation."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "Prof Deaton, 69, is currently professor of economics and international affairs at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University, in New Jersey.\nThe Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awards the prize, said that Prof Deaton's work has transformed several fields of economics.\nMore specifically, the organisation said he had made an impact on economic theory, and on the practical application of data to investigate poverty, and devise economic policy.\nThe headline to the statement from the academy that announced that Prof Deaton was its 2015 winner said: \"Consumption, great and small\". What does this mean?\nConsumption, to an economist, means spending on goods and services by individuals and households.\nUnderstanding it means looking at how consumers allocate spending between different things, how they divide their incomes between spending and saving, and how these patterns vary over time.\nThe \"great and small\" in the academy's headline reflects Prof Deaton's analysis of consumer spending across a whole economy, and at the level of the individual and the household.\nOne theme that runs through the academy's analysis of his work is the extensive use of data on spending taken from household surveys. Previously, economists worked much more from aggregate data for the whole economy.\nThis focus enabled Prof Deaton to produce a theoretical approach that was more consistent with the fluctuations in consumer spending that he found.\nA more arcane achievement was in developing (with another economist John Muellbauer) a theory of demand for goods and services - how people allocate their spending between different products - that was motivated by problems in earlier analysis.\nTheir system, and subsequent improvements by other researchers, \"has had an immense impact in academia as well as being greatly influential in practical policy evaluation\".\nProf Deaton has been an influential figure in development economics. The academy describes him as an important driving force in the transformation of this area of economics - in moving from aggregate data to household surveys.\nTo take one example - his research shed light on the question of whether rising incomes do lead to more calories being consumed, in other words to reducing malnutrition.\nHis work suggests that it does - so encouraging economic growth can help tackle malnutrition. If that were not the case it would be an argument for reorienting policy towards direct food aid.\nIn addition to the greater recognition of his work, and the further respect of his peers, Prof Deaton receives a financial price of 8m Swedish krona ($966,000; Â£630,000).\nBorn in the Scottish capital of Edinburgh, Prof Deaton attended Fettes College, a private school in the city, before going on to study at Cambridge University.\nAfter teaching at Cambridge and the University of Bristol, he continued his economics career in the US.\nHe holds both British and American citizenship.\nUnlike the other five annual Nobel prizes, the economics one was not established by Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, although like the Physics and Chemistry prizes it is awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\nInstead it was set up by Sweden's central bank in 1968 as a memorial to Mr Nobel, who died in 1896.\nIts official title is the Riksbank's Prize in Economic Sciences.", "answer": ["The 2015 Nobel Prize for Economics has been awarded to Scottish-born economist Angus Deaton."], "label": "SUM"}

When all tokens were \"spent\", a potential gift-giver was less likely to help than they had been in a setting where tokens had not yet been introduced.\nThe same effect was found in smaller groups, who were less generous when there was the option of receiving a token.\n\"Subjects basically latched on to monetary exchange, and stopped helping unless they received immediate compensation in a form of an intrinsically worthless object [a token].\n\"Using money does help large societies to achieve larger levels of co-operation than smaller societies, but it does so at a cost of displacing normal of voluntary help that is the bread and butter of smaller societies, in which everyone knows each other,\" said Prof Camera.\nBut he said that this negative result was not found in larger anonymous groups of 32, instead co-operation increased with the use of tokens.\n\"This is exciting because we introduced something that adds nothing to the economy, but it helped participants converge on a behaviour that is more trustworthy.\"\nHe added that the study reflected monetary exchange in daily life: \"Global interaction expands the set of trade opportunities, but it dilutes the level of information about others' past behaviour. In this sense, one can view tokens in our experiment as a parable for global monetary exchange.\"\nSam Bowles, of the Santa Fe Institute, US, who was not involved with the study, specialises in evolutionary co-operation.\nHe commented that co-operation among self-interested people will always occur on a vast scale when \"helping another\" consists of exchanging a commodity that can be bought or sold with tokens, for example a shirt.\n\"The really interesting finding in the study is that tokens change the behavioural foundations of co-operation, from generosity in the absence of the tokens, to self-interest when tokens are present.\"\n\"It's striking that once tokens become available, people generally do not help others except in return for a token.\"\nHe told BBC news that it was evidence for an already observed phenomenon called \"motivational crowding out, where paying an individual to do a task which they had already planned to do free of charge, could lead people to do this less\".\nHowever, Prof Bowles said that \"most of the goods and services that we need that make our lives possible and beautiful are not like shirts\".\n\"For these things, exchanging tokens could never work, which is why humans would never have become the co-operative species we are unless we had developed ethical and other regarding preferences.\"", "answer": ["A new study sheds light on how money affects human behaviour."], "label": "SUM"}

As time went on it looked more and more likely that victory would elude them but to their credit they stayed patient before a moment of magic from Eriksen finally unlocked the Palace defence.\nThe forward took full advantage of a moment when he was afforded a rare bit of space, shooting from distance beyond the reach of Palace keeper Wayne Hennessey.\nIt was not a classic performance by a Tottenham side that has scored at least three goals in each of their last three Premier League games but it was one that showed they have the ability to dig in and grind out a result - a side of their game that could prove crucial in the title run in.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nIt could have been a different game if Tottenham lost Victor Wanyama to a second booking in the first half.\nAfter picking up an early yellow card for a bad foul, the midfielder slid in late on Andros Townsend.

Since finishing the qualifying campaign in September last year, Scotland have played six friendlies, as well as four Cyprus Cup matches, and have one final friendly against the Republic of Ireland to play, all of which required SFA funding.\nThere are no match fees - which is exactly the same situation with the men's team, who receive a bonus to be shared amongst squad members should they qualify for major finals. However, the home-based players do receive a bursary to cover loss of earnings for the build-up to a participation in the Euro 2017 finals. The players also receive daily allowances while they are with the national team.\nIt came to a head in recent weeks, with PFA Scotland engaged by the squad to negotiate with the SFA on their behalf, but discussions began late last year to try to reach a resolution.\nThe head coach has insisted on being an independent figure, without supporting either side.

{"question": "Listen to Gemma's BBC Radio 1 documentary on the BBC iPlayer.\nThe mantra of the Games was to create an Olympic legacy to \"Inspire a Generation\", making sure that sport is accessible for everybody.\nBut there are still lots of barriers to young people in sport: money, gender and family - and how about just trying to be a normal young person? How do you balance training, school work and your social life?\nI've been able to look into these issues for a special BBC Radio 1 documentary as part of the Radio 1 Stories documentary strand.\nMaking the documentary was a great learning experience as I heard from Usain Bolt, Mo Farah, Jessica Ennis-Hill, Greg Rutherford, Gemma Gibbons, the Brownlee brothers, Karina Bryant and quite a few more about what it takes to make it to the top of the podium.\nBut I also discovered how hard it is to grow up attempting to become an elite athlete, thanks to the touching stories of four people who are smashing down barriers to follow their Olympic dream.\nThere's Aaron Turner, a 21-year-old judoka who struggles to make ends meet with the cost of training.\nRead the full BBC survey on Olympic legacy\nKyle Powell is a T45 Paralympic sprinter who had to move away from his friends and family to give himself the best shot.\nMercy Brown is a female weightlifter from Tower Hamlets, making her way in a sport that is traditionally dominated by men.\nAnd finally, Dan Neilson, a showjumper who used to box and play football but now loves this unconventional sport for a 21-year-old.\nBut the Olympic impact wasn't only felt by elite athletes - you didn't even have to be good at sport to be inspired.\nA couple of months ago I found myself in the unlikely scenario of doing a 10K run.\nStomp, stomp, stomp, I pounded along, desperate for it to be over, but not stopping nevertheless. My only training had been momentary jogging spurts, (endorphin chasing, I call it), a 'one lap' jog around my local patch of grass.\nTo give myself the tiniest bit of credit, I do sometimes go to the gym - my trainer their calls me 'Bambi' as my balancing ability is abysmal.\nSome people at the gym think I'm unhinged because I'll often be vocally repeating the mantra of finding life's 'balance'. But I figure that if the joy I find in food can be matched by an hour's exercise and wipe out the post-indulgence guilt, then why not try?\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nDespite being terrified on the day of my 10k, I was invigorated by how many people had signed up to do it. It lifted me and forced me not to stop.\nThe velocity of sport in numbers I find giddy. There is a new high to be found in looking after yourself and engaging in sport and fitness.\nIn the UK 1.4 million more people are playing sport regularly since the bid to host the Olympics was won in 2005. If there was a 'well-being revolution' gently rumbling along over the past five years, then last year's Olympics jolted us all into action.\nSport became the new rock 'n' roll, with its stars our new idols. Glitzy, loud, and unpredictable. Glamour and spandex in abundance.\nThis revolution swept me up unexpectedly. I didn't know how much sport could connect with us normal, crisp-munching human beings.

No radar equipment was used near these tents.\nEarlier in the day, officers in Metropolitan Police uniforms were driven to a separate part of the cordoned-off area, where they were joined by Portuguese police and local forestry workers with strimmers.\nA man in plain clothes wheeled the radar equipment onto a section of ground that had earlier been cleared.\nOfficers from the Met and South Wales Police were also working with sniffer dogs and using spades to help sift through the undergrowth.\nThey were being overseen by the Met's Det Ch Insp Andy Redwood, the senior officer investigating the case.\nThe painstaking search of a site in the resort of Praia da Luz has been continuing, with a forensics officer joining the police team on Wednesday.\nWork seems to have been concentrated in one particular area, with police going back and forth to a section of land at the perimeter of the site.

{"question": "\"Where is Mullah Omar?\" is a question sources say is being increasingly and angrily directed at the commander regarded as the acting head, Akhtar Mohammad Mansour.\nCommander Mansour has long been reported to be fighting off threats to his authority from more hardline Taliban opposed to any peace talks, including Abdul Qayum Zakir.\nThe Taliban are also facing a growing challenge from the still small, but increasingly significant presence of the so-called Islamic State in Afghanistan. Videos have emerged of disgruntled Taliban fighters swearing allegiance to the IS's self-declared Caliph Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\nThe Iraqi cleric, who also declared a modern day caliphate in areas under IS control in Iraq and Syria, has publicly mocked the religious and political leadership of Mullah Omar.\nIn a Taliban movement said to be founded on a pledge of allegiance to the Amir ul-Mumineen (Commander of the Faithful), Mullah Omar's authority was regarded as a binding force of political and military strength.\n\"I really hope peace talks are concluded before Mullah Omar dies,\" a former senior Taliban official nervously remarked to me several years ago with unexpected candour about the movement's leader. \"When he's gone, it will be much harder to maintain Taliban unity,\" he admitted with palpable concern.\nOur conversation, outside Afghanistan, took place at a time when Nato-led forces were killing many mid-level Taliban commanders in their operations in southern Afghanistan. That was raising concern that younger, more radicalised fighters, without a strong allegiance to the Taliban leader, would rise through the ranks and be hard to keep in line.\nIn 2010, when US diplomats first engaged in face-to-face talks with the Taliban through what later became known as the movement's Political Office in the Gulf state of Qatar, they first sought to establish that the Talibs were acting with Mullah Omar's authority. At the time, US diplomats involved in the process told me credible assurances were received that Syed Tayyab Agha, his former personal secretary, had his blessing.\nThat green light was, however, said to be strictly limited to negotiations with the Americans about Taliban prisoners and the presence of foreign troops in Afghanistan.\nThey eventually resulted in last year's swap of the remaining American soldier in Taliban captivity, Bowe Bergdahl, for five Taliban members held at Guantanamo Bay.\nThis year, in the midst of a series of unprecedented informal meetings between the Taliban's Political Office and Afghan government officials, Taliban sources emphasised they still did not have formal authorisation from Mullah Omar to negotiate officially and openly with the Afghan government.\nThat again raised the most salient issue: how to get a ruling from a leader who has not been seen in public since late 2001 when the Taliban movement was ousted in Afghanistan after the attacks of 11 September. Even his recorded messages stopped several years ago.\nTaliban officials often insisted their leader had to keep an exceptionally low profile because of US efforts to kill or capture him. But he was widely rumoured to be in Pakistan, despite Islamabad's denials. A senior Afghan official told me a few years ago that the Americans had confirmed to him that Mullah Omar was living in the southern Pakistani city of Karachi.\nThis month, a written message from Mullah Omar suddenly appeared,  to mark the Islamic Eid Festival. It did not directly refer to a new separate process of peace talks being organised by the Pakistani government which represented the first publicly recognised formal talks.\nBut the text said \"peaceful interactions with the enemies is not prohibited\" under Islamic tradition. It led to speculation over whether the message had been written by Mullah Omar himself, or someone who wanted his seal of legitimacy.\nReports of the Taliban leader's death have circulated for years but these latest ones have now emerged just days before another round of peace talks in Pakistan is about to get under way at the end of this month.\nThey also come at a time of disagreement over who should represent the Taliban in any negotiations with the Afghan government.\nSources say Pakistani military intelligence officers, who have long had close ties to the Taliban, are urging Taliban field commanders they have worked with to come to the table instead of members of the Political Office in Qatar with whom they have had difficult relations.\nAfghan President Ashraf Ghani, who has adopted a new policy of working closely with the Pakistan government and military on Taliban issues, is said to be giving Islamabad considerable leeway in a negotiating process making slow and indeterminate progress.\nBefore the first round of talks in the Pakistani hill resort  of Murree in early July, Mr Ghani was said to be under mounting pressure to abandon his approach to Pakistan, which was markedly different from his predecessor Hamid Karzai's strained relations with Islamabad.\nAnd there's the larger question of how committed Taliban commanders are to a political process when they continue to conduct bloody attacks not just against military and police targets but also brazen assaults on Afghan civilians everywhere from crowded markets to the country's national assembly.\nNumerous countries are known to have been involved for years in secret and not so secret efforts to bring the Taliban to the table including China, Norway, Britain, and some private mediation groups.\nThe legitimacy conveyed by the mythical Mullah Omar was always regarded as essential even if the reclusive leader had long ceased to be involved in the day-to-day running of the movement.\nNow the issue of who can replace such a powerful figurehead is emerging as one of the most significant challenges to its survival as a cohesive political and military force.", "answer": ["Whether or not Mullah Omar is dead or alive, his long absence from public view is posing a growing threat to the strength of his splintering Afghan Taliban movement."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "To give some idea of the amount of the currency that represents - there were more than 90 billion banknotes in circulation in India last March.\nMost central banks destroy soiled and mutilated banknotes on a regular basis and replace them with new, crisp ones.\nThe Reserve Bank of India, similarly, shreds such notes and makes briquettes of them. But they are not your usual briquettes.\nBriquettes - usually made of farm waste in India - are used for cooking, lighting and heating. They are cheaper than coal, have lower ash content, are less polluting, and easier to store and pack. They are mostly used as fuel in factory boilers.\nBut briquettes made out of shredded cash are brittle and serve no such purpose, a senior central bank official told me.\nSo the bank's 27 shredding and briquetting machines in 19 offices across India will now snip the expired banknotes into the smallest of pieces and the resulting briquettes will be then dumped in India's vast landfills.\nSometimes the shredded currency is also recycled to make files, calendars and paper weights and ballpoint pen shells, tea coasters, cups and small trays as souvenirs for guests.\nThe practice is similar in the US: counterfeit banknotes are sent to the Secret Service, while unfit notes are shredded and sent to landfills or given away as souvenirs to the public touring the Federal Reserve Bank.\nCentral bank officials believe shredding 20 billion banknotes will not be a huge challenge. In 2015-16 the Reserve Bank of India destroyed more than 16 billion soiled notes. More than 14 billion were removed in 2012-2013 after nearly 500,000 fake notes were found in the system.\n\"Destroying so much cash is not a challenge because we have enough shredding and briquetting machines with very high capacities.

{"question": "Campaign funding promises have been made but whoever forms the next government will find some challenging financial issues highlighted in their ministerial red boxes.\nThis week, reports of a tightening of the financial thumb screws have emerged. There is talk of rationing and, as one source told me, \"unpalatable things\" being contemplated by hospital managers and local health commissioners.\nUnder what's been billed as a \"capped expenditure process\", NHS England and the regulator NHS Improvement are telling some trusts to stick within spending limits even if that means tough decisions on the provision of non-urgent care.\nThe new pressure on hospitals and local health commissioning groups in England comes after some trusts overshot agreed spending targets during the last financial year.\nSince the start of this year, from the beginning of April, it has become clear that the biggest over-spenders have been unable to agree their so-called \"control totals\". They have now been told to take firmer action to keep a grip on spending.\nThe Health Service Journal (HSJ) reported that NHS officials have contacted health managers in 14 areas of England with a series of proposals for controlling budgets.  These include extending waiting times for routine procedures and treatments, downgrading certain services and limiting the number of operations carried out by the private sector for the NHS.\nHSJ first revealed the tougher spending regime in April, quoting from a letter sent to those local health leaders who could not agree their budgets.\nThey were asked to decide \"from which areas further expenditure reductions will be made\", including reviewing the range of medicines prescribed.\nInterestingly, the letter and subsequent dialogue has been with both commissioners, who can limit what they are prepared to pay for, and trusts who might save money by curbing the volume of non-urgent care provided to patients.\nThere was a clue to this tougher approach in the update to the NHS Five Year Forward View plan, published at the end of March.  The finger is pointed at those organisations which had historically substantially overspent their \"fair shares of NHS funding\".\nThey are accused of \"living off bail-outs\" taken from other services. They are then told to confront \"difficult choices\" and if necessary \"scale back spending on locally unaffordable services\".\nAn NHS England spokesperson said no final decisions had been made and when final choices were made locally they would need to be approved nationally. But there was no denying the fact that in some areas hospital managers and commissioners were being told to go further than before to keep a lid on spending.\nThe background to this is that NHS England is receiving a much smaller budget increase this year than in 2016/17 which, though originally billed as a generous \"frontloaded\" settlement, appeared to only just cover what the service needed. Patient demand will continue to outstrip the money available with the financial pressure even more intense this year.\nThose who see the NHS as a bottomless pit always requiring more money to be poured in will call for more efficiency savings before another bailout is contemplated.  Those who argue that the NHS has been underfunded for some years, with the share of national income devoted to health lagging behind other leading economies, will say the only answer is higher levels of government funding.\nIt's a familiar debate and one which won't go away after polling day.\nThe three main health think tanks, The King'sFund, Nuffield Trust and the Health Foundation, wrote a joint letter this week arguing that no political party was offering enough extra spending to cope with the demographic and demand pressures on the NHS.\nThey estimated that an extra Â£20 billion annually would be needed by 2022 over and above the most generous manifesto pledge.\nThe think tanks argue that failure to provide sufficient funding will result in longer waiting times for patients and a decline in levels of care.\nRecent reports indicate NHS chiefs are already planning for that to happen.", "answer": ["Money, money, money - it's a familiar background theme across the NHS in England, but the volume is increasing."], "label": "SUM"}

The deal allowed Leyton to perform a song - Johnny Remember Me - which spent four weeks at number one in 1961.\nBy 1966, after a period of bankruptcy, he became a booking agent for The Who, luring them onto his own Reaction Records label, where they recorded the hit single Substitute.\nHe went on to manage Cream and Eric Clapton, before signing the Bee Gees in 1967 and steering them to international success with an intensive promotional campaign for the single New York Mining Disaster 1941.\nBy the early 1970s, though, the Bee Gees had fallen out of favour, and Clapton was inactive due to drug addiction. Stigwood turned his attention to musicals, producing the movie version of Jesus Christ Superstar and The Who's rock opera Tommy.\nHaving bought the management rights to Evita and Jesus Christ Superstar, Stigwood was instrumental in cracking down on unlicensed performances of the musicals in the US - including school productions - to ensure profits went into pockets of its creators.\nHe also formed RSO Records (short for Robert Stigwood Organization), where he resuscitated the careers of his two biggest acts - sending Clapton to the top of the charts with I Shot The Sheriff, and rebranding the Bee Gees as falsetto-voiced disco lynchpins on Jive Talking.\nThe Australian's midas touch continued in the late 1970s, when he produced Saturday Night Fever, making a global star of television actor John Travolta and selling 40 million copies of the Bee Gees-powered soundtrack.\nStigwood followed it with the evergreen teen musical Grease, and was particularly proud of casting fellow Australian Olivia Newton John in the role of Sandy.\nBut he faltered with the 1978 Beatles musical Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band - a fantastical but unfocused movie starring The Bee Gees, Peter Frampton and comedian Frankie Howerd.\n\"If you like the Beatles and you like movies, do yourself a favour and stay away,\" wrote influential US film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum. Audiences took note, and the film flopped at the box office, although the soundtrack sold well.\nStigwood went on to produce the similarly-disappointing sequels Grease 2 and Staying Alive - but found success later in life with the Madonna-starring musical Evita, which won the 1997 Golden Globe for best film.\nThe movie's lyricist, Sir Tim Rice, paid tribute to Stigwood on Twitter, calling him \"extraordinary, innovative [and] generous\".\n\"[He was] a vital part of my life,\" he added.", "answer": ["Robert Stigwood, who managed Cream and the Bee Gees before producing the rock musicals Saturday Night Fever and Grease has died at the age of 81."], "label": "SUM"}

The committee is made up of senior princes of the Al Saud royal family and is known as the Allegiance Council.\nMohammed bin Salman's new promotion to crown prince was approved by 31 out of 34 members of the council.\nAnalysts say those in power tend to appoint their sons to roles that will enhance their chances of being promoted - so when monarchs and crown princes change, sons can come into and out of favour.\nKing Salman, a son of King Abdulaziz, acceded to the throne in January 2015 after the death of his half-brother Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz.\nHe launched his first major cabinet reshuffle a few months later, promoting Mohammed bin Nayef to crown prince and Mohammed bin Salman, who was relatively unknown at that time, to deputy crown prince.\nExperts say the second reshuffle has reduced uncertainty over the line of succession, and means the king has averted a potential power struggle between his son and his nephew.\nThe decree promoting Mohammed bin Salman includes a clause preventing him from appointing one of his own sons as his heir.\nIt is the most influential Arab country - and a key ally of Western powers including the US and the UK.\nThe kingdom is also the world's second largest oil producer - and the Saudi royal family is thought to be one of the richest ruling families in the world.\nIt is guardian of the two most holy sites in Islam, and regards itself as leader of the Sunni community worldwide.\nThe kingdom is a key player in Sunni attempts to block Shia Iranian influence in the Middle East.\nIt has launched air strikes on Yemen to fight Houthi rebels, who Saudi Arabia believes are backed by Iran. However, the campaign has been criticised for human rights violations - including the killing many civilians.\nRecently, Saudi Arabia also joined efforts to impose a blockade on Qatar.\nPrince Mohammed bin Nayef was the kingdom's security chief for many years and was known for his strong stance against jihadist militants.\nAs deputy prime minister and interior minister, he headed up the counter-terrorism portfolio, and also had good relations with Saudi Arabia's Western allies.\nState media broadcast footage showing Mohammed bin Nayef meeting Mohammed bin Salman after the succession was announced.\nThe former crown prince said \"I am content\" and \"I am going to rest now.

It also says Germany - at the time an ally of the Ottomans - bears some guilt for doing nothing to stop the killings.\nThe reactions from Ankara are every bit as strong as feared. Turkey's foreign minister even accused Berlin of trying to deflect from the dark episodes of its own history, a clear reference to Germany's Nazi past.\nBut for many German politicians this vote was about exactly the opposite: it was about dealing with not just Turkey's difficult 20th century history, but also Germany's.\nMany of the speeches in parliament focused on German responsibility in the 1915 killings. At the time, the German empire was a military ally of the Ottomans, and is accused of knowing about the massacres and not doing anything to prevent them. So for many Germans this resolution is about facing up to German historical guilt - something modern Germany is founded upon.\nBut the big question is what this all means for Europe's attempts to solve the migrant crisis. Diplomatic relations may be strained. But the hope in Berlin is that tensions don't scupper the EU's new refugee deal with Turkey.\nUnder a deal struck in March, Turkey agreed to take back migrants - including Syrians - arriving on Greek islands, in return for EU aid and a pledge to give Turks visa-free travel to most of Europe.\nGermany accepted 1.1 million migrants last year - by far the highest influx in the EU.\nGerman-Turkish relations were also strained this year by the case of comedian Jan Boehmermann, whose obscene poem about Mr Erdogan prompted a criminal complaint from the Turkish leader.\nLast month a court in Hamburg ruled that Boehmermann's poem was satire, but banned him from repeating the sexual references in it, deeming them unacceptable.\nGermany plans to repeal a clause in the constitution prohibiting insults that target foreign leaders - the clause invoked by Turkey in the complaint.\nFind out more about what happened\nArmenian tragedy still raw in Turkey", "answer": ["The German parliament has approved a resolution declaring that the mass killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks during World War One was a \"genocide\"."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "Will he be less outspoken? Will he temper his Twitter tirades? Will he back down from his calls for a Muslim ban?\nMaybe. Maybe not.\nBut there are some significant ways Mr Trump is already altering his campaign strategy - sometimes in direct conflict with promises and assertions he made during his long, successful race to the top of the Republican Party.\nHere are five.\nMr Trump has repeatedly boasted that he was paying for his campaign out of his own personal fortune.\n\"By self-funding my campaign, I am not controlled by my donors, special interests or lobbyists,\" he posted on Facebook back in September. \"I am only working for the people of the US!\"\nEven though that's not exactly true - Mr Trump was loaning his campaign money and could someday pay it back, in addition to raising funds through donations - it was a central part of his pitch to those put off by the current political system.\nNow, however, all pretence is gone. Mr Trump announced he's hired a veteran money man - a former Goldman Sachs partner, no less - as his national finance chairman. And on Tuesday he reached an agreement with the Republican Party to conduct joint fundraising through a network of committees that can take donations of up to $449,400 (Â£307,850) per person.\nMr Trump's move is an acknowledgement that he would be hard-pressed to self-finance a general election campaign, which could cost more than $1bn. He's wealthy - but he's not that wealthy.\nMr Trump has repeatedly insisted campaign-funded opinion polls are a waste of money.\n\"I don't have pollsters,\" he said last August. \"I don't want to be unreal. I want to be me. I have to be me. You know, we have enough of that in Washington, with pollsters telling everybody what to say and everybody being controlled by the special interests, and the lobbyists, et cetera, and the donors.\"\nIn fact, Mr Trump was dismissive of the whole idea of data-driven campaigns - including President Barack Obama's winning presidential bids.\n\"Obama got the votes much more so than his data processing machine, and I think the same is true with me,\" he told the Associated Press.\nThat was before the Trump campaign hired Republican pollster Tony Fabrizio, a veteran of the presidential campaigns of Rand Paul, Rick Perry and Bob Dole and a host of other state-level candidates.\nAccurate, focused polling can serve as a presidential campaign's eyes and ears. It provides detailed information that helps a candidate's team determine where and how to spend resources.\nAt least that's what high-paid professional political pollsters will tell their candidates. And now Donald Trump is listening.\nLike many Republicans, Mr Trump loved to make fun of Mr Obama's reliance on Teleprompters during public events.\n\"I've always said, if you run for president, you shouldn't be allowed to use Teleprompters,\" he said in October. \"Because you don't even know if the guy's smart.\"\nPart of Mr Trump's appeal was his off-the-cuff style. He could say anything at any time, no matter how controversial - compared to controlled, careful career politicians like Hillary Clinton.\n\"I watched Hillary the other day, and she has the biggest teleprompters I've ever seen,\" he said in January. \"In fact, if you're sitting on that side of the room or that side of the room you can't see her because when they are outside, they are painted black and you can't even see her.\"\nThen Mr Trump used a Teleprompter to deliver a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee in March. And he used one to give a foreign policy address in April.\nHis campaign has said that more substantive, scripted speeches are in store, including on the military, education reforms and the Supreme Court.\nThis, campaign manager Corey Lewandowski told the Washington Post, represents \"the natural maturation of the campaign\".\nOver the course of his primary campaign Mr Trump hasn't been afraid to pick fights with fellow conservatives. He memorably sparred with Fox News moderator Megyn Kelly in the first Republican debate in August. He repeatedly criticised his party's foreign policy establishment. And he relentlessly disparaged the Republican Party leaders.\n\"They win their election, and they go to Washington, and they're with their wife or husband, and they say: 'Look at the beautiful columns. I don't want to leave this place, this is so beautiful,'\" Mr Trump said of Republican politicians in December. \"And they let us down.\"\nNow Trump has reunited with Kelly in a make-nice Fox interview. He's given a foreign-policy speech to a Washington think tank. He's made the rounds on Capitol Hill and \"planted seeds\" with Speaker of the House Paul Ryan.\nOn Wednesday afternoon he even had a closed-door meeting with the dean of the conservative foreign-policy establishment, Henry Kissinger.\nIn the past Republicans have pivoted from the right to the political middle. Mr Trump, it seems, is pivoting from the outside to the inside.\nOn Wednesday Mr Trump released his much anticipated list of potential Supreme Court nominees. For an unconventional candidate, it was decidedly conventional.\nWhile one judge, Don Willett of Texas, has an affinity for Twitter that almost rivals Mr Trump's, the list - eight men, three women, all white - is only surprising for its adherence to conservative orthodoxy.\nIt looks like it could have been the product of the right-wing Heritage Foundation. In fact, it largely was.\nAll of the names are judges currently on either state or federal courts, even though there is no constitutional requirement that Supreme Court nominees even be lawyers.\nWhile no one was expecting Mr Trump to suggest Hulk Hogan or Sarah Palin for the high court, his list looks a lot like business as usual for a Republican presidential candidate.\nThat may be just he way he wants it - but it's also not exactly what his primary campaign was all about.", "answer": ["Donald Trump has effectively won the Republican presidential nomination, leaving pundits and analysts wondering if a rhetorical \"pivot\" to a general election campaign is in the works."], "label": "SUM"}

Nothing else could be salvaged.\n\"Some of the people in those pictures are not even with us anymore, those are our memories,\" said Ms Lopez, 32. They had already sent their two young daughters to Ms Lopez's mother, on higher ground.\n\"They're safe,\" Mr Fernandez said. \"But we've lost every material possession we owned.\"\nTheir house, on Rippling Water Drive, was one of thousands in the area that flooded on Monday as Hurricane Harvey dumped record rainfall on Houston and the nearby Addicks reservoir filled beyond capacity for the first time in its 70-year history.\nAs the level in the reservoir rose past its 108ft (33m) limit, water began pouring over an emergency spillway. Fearing the dam around the reservoir would fail, the Army Corps of Engineers began to let out 4,000 cubic feet (113 cubic metres) of water per second into Buffalo Bayou, flooding nearby neighbourhoods including Bear Creek.\n\"The flooding here is not just from the rain, the flooding here is because they released the reservoir,\" Ms Lopez said.\n\"They notified us they would do it at 7pm and at 1am they released the water. We didn't have enough time. Now everything is gone. If you walk down to my house now, all you will find is a wreck.\"\nMr Fernandez flicked away his cigarette and, after a final glance towards the house, the couple got in their truck and made their way to Ms Lopez's brother's house.\nThere were just a handful of residents left on Rippling Water Drive on Tuesday morning. An eerie silence had descended over the worst-affected parts of Bear Creek, punctuated only by sporadic calls from volunteer rescue boats and the chop of a military helicopter making low passes overhead.\nAs the water level rose, there were fears that a torrent would wash through. The Addicks and Barker reservoirs, built by the government in the 1940s to hold back excessive rainwater along the bayou, store more than half a billion cubic metres of water between them, and the US Army Corps of Engineers has rated the decaying dams around the reservoirs as \"extremely high risk\".\nThe flooding in the surrounding neighbourhoods would last at least four to five weeks, warned Jeff Lindner, a meteorologist at the Harris County Flood Control District. On Tuesday he advised anyone still there to get out. \"Once the water comes into the street, you aren't going to be able to leave,\" he said.\nIn the Colonies neighbourhoods, just streets away from where water flows from the reservoirs into the bayou, a volunteer army had brought together jeeps, pick-up trucks and military surplus vehicles to rescue stranded residents. Organised on Facebook by two local off-road recovery groups, and manned from a makeshift radio control centre a few miles away, the group scoured the flooded streets for anyone stuck in their home.\nJosh James, 26, waded through chest-high water to get people onto a truck.\nHe helped Christie Mueck and her husband out of their house with their dog. Newlyweds, the couple moved to the neighbourhood just two months ago from Layfayette, Louisiana.\n\"I have five years of research in that house,\" said Ms Mueck, holding back tears. \"Everything's in there. If it washes away, I won't get my PhD.\"\nWith 12 evacuees and five dogs, and its huge wheels completely submerged, the truck began to make its way back to higher ground. It was one of six being operated by the volunteers in the area, Mr James said, along with 40 boats and a host of smaller off-road vehicles.\nAll around the Addicks reservoir, volunteers were out in the water, some well-equipped and tightly organised, others making use of whatever they had to hand. With no work while the nearly oilfield is closed, Anthony Kacala, Bertley Taylor, and Michael Hernandez grabbed a canoe and a rubber dinghy and searched online for trouble spots.\nThe three friends rescued 12 people from flooded homes nearby on Monday night, they said, before loading up Facebook to check where else they might be needed.\nOn another street nearby, Octavio Zambrano, 27, was driving his military surplus jeep around with three friends, offering help to anyone in need. Brian Foreman, 34, came in a boat to rescue his father, then stuck around to help, ferrying a woman back to her house to retrieve medicines and clothes.\nThe fleet of volunteer rescue vehicles went in and out of the worst-affected areas, searching for anyone left behind. The truck containing the Muecks slowly made its way to a staging area. The couple said they would try to connect with family members, or else join the nearly 20,000 people around the city preparing to spend the night in a shelter.\nAs water began pouring out of the Addicks reservoir on Monday, two local schools were transformed into makeshift shelters. By that night they were full and began turning people away.\nSome 1,100 people had crammed into Morton Ranch High School, bedding down along the corridors and in the canteen. The handful of inflatable beds available were given to the elderly and the sick, everyone else slept as best they could on the floor.\nSat at a canteen table on Tuesday, looking shattered, Latonia Buckley held her two infant daughters in her arms. Twenty-four hours earlier, she had put the two girls onto a mattress and floated them out of the house as the water poured in.\nThe family had one more night available at the shelter, then they would have to leave. With her home wrecked, and more water threatening to spill from the reservoir into the neighbourhood, going home was not an option.\n\"We have nowhere else to go, we are facing sleeping in our car tomorrow night,\" she said. \"When we opened the car door earlier, water poured out.\"\nLike many people making a makeshift home at the school, Ms Buckley had no flood insurance. \"It's devastating,\" she said. \"You can't protect your kids, you can't provide for your kids. It's doesn't matter what you have in the bank, you have nowhere to go.\"\nDespite the releases on Monday, water was still pouring over the Addicks reservoir spillway at an uncontrolled rate on Tuesday evening. At the Barker reservoir, the water level was rising and threatening to spill over.\n\"We just don't know exactly how this is going to play out because its never happened before,\" said meteorologist Mr Lindner.\nThe most difficult question for many of those bedding down at Morton Ranch High School for a second night seemed to be one of the most simple: What next?\n\"I really don't know,\" said Ms Buckley. \"Pray, I guess.\"", "answer": ["As the rain began to fall harder around Bear Creek Village on Tuesday, Leticia Lopez and her husband Edgar Fernandez huddled under an awning, pausing for a cigarette and a final look down the street in the direction of their house."], "label": "SUM"}

Of that, £176.5m was spent on local content and Scottish-made BBC network output, 55% of the total raised.\nThis was a sharp decline from the £203m spend the previous year, which was 63% of the £323m collected. The funds not spent locally go towards BBC programmes developed elsewhere and aired across the UK.\nIn comparison, 95% of licence fee funds raised in Wales in 2015/16 were spent in Wales - including on network-wide programmes like Doctor Who, Casualty and Crimewatch - with the figure for Northern Ireland standing at 74%.\nMs MacKinnon said: \"I have made it very clear that it is my ambition to change that number. The percentage of the licence fee collected in Scotland I think has to reflect better the amount spent in Scotland.\n\"I don't want to commit to a figure exactly at the moment, but certainly an increase on what is the case that moment, which is 55% of the licence fee.\n\"I think we have a new opportunity to define exactly what kind of BBC in Scotland audiences expect and the kind of resource it rightly should claim, relative to the amount of licence fee collected in Scotland.\"\nThe new director also pledged to abolish \"lift and shift\", where programmes traditionally produced elsewhere are moved to Scotland in order to meet quotas.\nHolyrood's culture committee issued a report describing this practice as \"subverting the spirit of the quota\", with MSPs saying this gave them \"serious cause for concern\".\nMs MacKinnon said this had happened due to a target in 2008 to raise network television productions coming from Scotland from 3% of the total aired to 8.6%. She said she had made a \"serious commitment\" to see the practice end.\nShe said: \"I understand why that happened early doors, I don't think that should happen any more and we've had a very solid commitment to the effect that that will not happen except in extremis.\"\nMs MacKinnon also said she was targeting an \"improvement in appreciation\" of BBC Scotland's news output, saying it was \"really important\" to consolidate public trust in the corporation following events like the 2014 independence referendum.\nShe said: \"We have very successful news output, but there's no doubt that there was a feeling among a significant percentage of the population - not the total population - that trust might need to be rebuilt.\n\"I think it was proven by research undertaken by the BBC Trust that that we had not breached any impartiality and could not be accused of being biased.\n\"Did we sometimes get it wrong? Possibly.\n\"If we get it wrong - and there's no doubt we are all human beings, and we can do - we should put our hands up and say yeah, sorry, we may have got that wrong, but we certainly, as far as I'm concerned, can't be accused of bias.\"\nMs MacKinnon was asked about the case of Nick Robinson who as BBC political editor was the subject of controversy during the independence campaign.\nThe BBC Trust and Editorial Complaints Unit found that Mr Robinson's assertion that then-First Minister Alex Salmond had not answered a question put to him during a news conference gave a misleading impression.\nBut it concluded that his report was not intentionally biased and rejected complaints.\nMr Salmond subsequently claimed BBC bias was a \"significant factor\" in the outcome of the independence referendum.\nMs MacKinnon said the BBC should be more open about admitting when mistakes are made, while explaining its position and defending its journalism against claims of bias.\nShe said: \"I really do believe that we need to get our narrative right, and we need to be out there a bit more often just explaining some of that.\n\"It's arguable that had we done that, then the population would have understood better what it is that we're here to do.\n\"Getting that story out, whether it's from the director general or me or someone else, it's something I will want to address.\"\nThe new director said it was \"regrettable\" that this had not happened more often during the independence referendum.\nShe said: \"I can understand the reasons for the reluctance and reticence to be there, given the tension around the whole debate.

{"question": "The Iraqi authorities hope the joint offensive will succeed in pushing IS out of the city, which would be a crushing defeat for the militants and leave them with very little territory in Iraq.\nBut over the past week IS has been hitting back hard on the battlefield, and in various towns and cities.\nIt is gradually revealing a battle plan which it has probably been working on since it seized control of Mosul in June 2014, knowing that this day of reckoning would eventually come.\nThis is the latest tactic deployed by the militants since the offensive began, with a spate of attacks around the country starting last Friday in the strategic, Kurdish-controlled city of Kirkuk.\nAt least 100 IS gunmen and suicide bombers, including some who had been members of sleeper cells living inside the city, tried to take control of key government and police buildings as well as attacking a power station being built there.\nAs they entered Kirkuk, they called on Sunni Muslims to come out of their homes and fight with them and some heeded the call, according to one source who spoke to the BBC.\nAt least 98 people were killed in the attack, most of them civilians.\nSources say 2,000 Kurdish fighters (known as the Peshmerga) were pulled back from the Mosul offensive, to help bring the situation in Kirkuk back under control.\nThe security forces' commander in Kirkuk, Halo Najat, told the BBC he believed the militants also planned to cut the main road from Baghdad to Kirkuk and the road from Kirkuk to Mosul to disrupt supply lines for Iraqi and Kurdish troops involved in the Mosul offensive. However, they were killed before they could do this.\nSince the assault on Kirkuk, there have been attacks on the town of Rutba in western Iraq and the Sinjar region to the west of Mosul.\nThe sight of a cluster of cars or trucks speeding towards the front lines of the Mosul offensive has sparked panic among some Iraqi troops and Kurdish fighters, who know it is highly likely the vehicles are packed with explosives and driven by suicide bombers.\nThis is a new tactic by IS designed to make it difficult for troops to stop all the vehicles reaching their positions.\nSmall arms fire is not effective as the vehicles normally have armoured plating around them. Destroying them requires several anti-tank missiles to be fired rapidly.\nThe alternative is to call for air strikes, if there is time.\nThe militants try to conceal suicide vehicles before they are used.\nAs the Iraqi army and Kurdish forces have advanced towards Mosul, regaining control of towns and villages which had been in the hands of IS, they have discovered networks of tunnels dug in many areas, a classic tactic for guerrilla warfare.\nThey seem to be primarily defensive, designed to protect the militants from air strikes, artillery and other attacks. Inside the tunnels troops have found sleeping bags, food supplies, water, and even electricity cables so the users have light.\nThe tunnels are often dug beneath buildings, including mosques, so the excavation work cannot be spotted. But the tunnels can also be used for surprise attacks.\nIn one of the most dramatic moments captured on video since the offensive began, an IS militant climbs out of a tunnel in a rural area and opens fire on a group of soldiers who had presumably thought they were on safe ground. The man then blows himself up before the soldiers can react.\nIt is assumed that there is a similar network of tunnels in Mosul city itself, which could enable IS fighters and their leaders to hide during the anticipated assault and if necessary escape.\nTroops have found booby-traps in tunnels which the militants have been forced to flee, including one which had been attached to a copy of the Koran.\nBooby-traps, improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and mines have also featured in the defensive plans of IS, with huge numbers left on roads and in buildings in the towns and villages which they have been forced to abandon as the military offensive has progressed.\nMuch concern has already been expressed about the possibility of IS using civilians in areas under its control - particularly in Mosul itself - as human shields.\nA senior Kurdish intelligence officer told me recently that they had information that IS had already started doing this, describing it as a sign of weakness and desperation.\nThe officer was not clear where this was happening, but if it is correct, it will make the assault on Mosul city even more complicated than it was already likely to be, assuming IS does decide to stand and fight.\nIraqi army generals have told me their key concern in this offensive is to avoid civilian casualties.

I started drawing for print then.\"\nFrom there, he went on to illustrate nearly 300 books with writers such as Joan Aiken, Michael Rosen and John Yeoman.\nBlake also worked on more than 150 episodes of the BBC children's show Jackanory, providing the illustrations for the books narrated for the young audience.\n\"I draw every day - unless I'm being interviewed,\" Blake told the BBC.\n\"What is nice is to have different kinds of things to do.\"\nBlake began working with Dahl after a meeting in 1975 set up by their publisher.\nBy that point, Dahl had already published some of his most famous works including James and The Giant Peach, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Fantastic Mr Fox.\n\"Initially I was rather apprehensive because he was a big chap and very famous, but it was a relationship that worked,\" said Blake.\n\"Because I had established myself as an illustrator, I had something to bring to it.\"\nBlake became the first ever Children's Laureate when the position was created in 1999, using his tenure to promote literature for the young.\nAmong his other accolades are the JM Barrie lifetime achievement award, which he received in 2008, the Hans Christian Andersen Award for illustration in 2002 and an honorary degree from the Anglia Ruskin university in Cambridge.\nHe was made an OBE in 1988, a CBE in 2004 and will receive his knighthood at Buckingham Palace during 2013, for his services to illustration.\nThe 80-year-old's most recent collaboration has been with comic actor and writer David Walliams.\nThey first worked together on Walliams' debut children's novel The Boy in the Dress, which was published in 2008.\nHe admitted he was initially apprehensive about working with the Little Britain co-creator.\n\"I was also worried it would have loads of projectile vomiting,\" he said, \"but I wanted to do it as soon as I read it.\"\nHe added: \"I had breakfast with David and I think we were on the same wavelength. It was very nice because he wanted me to do it and I got so involved in it that I did twice as many drawings as I was supposed to.\"\nThe pair have now worked on five books together, including Walliams' latest book Mr Stink, about a girl who befriends a local tramp and hides him in her garden shed to stop him being driven out of town.\nWalliams said of Blake: \"His work kind of means children's books somehow, so even if you haven't studied it or don't pay attention to who illustrators are, you know his work.\n\"It has been copied everywhere so many times that it is now part of the culture.\"\nHe added: \"I think the magic of his work is that it doesn't tell you exactly what the person looks like, it allows you add your own imagination to it.\"\nAs well as illustrating books, Blake also does work with hospitals and mental health units, decorating buildings with his sketches.\n\"It's a different kind of brief, a different kind of audience.

His allies swept to power in several big Spanish cities in regional elections back in May.\nBoth men sell themselves as a new brand of politician.\nMr Iglesias says the rich should pay more to end poverty and he would force King Felipe to stand in an election for the position of head of state.\nMr Rivera is socially liberal, but committed to free-market economics.\nThey both claim they will end corruption. Scandals have plagued Spain's traditional parties in recent years.\nAn impromptu exchange on the issue of corruption between Mr Iglesias and Celia Villalobos, a senior figure from the ruling Popular Party (PP), was trending on Twitter this week.\nShe warned him not to go around accusing all of her party of being corrupt.\nSpain's incumbent prime minister, the slightly dour Galician, Mariano Rajoy, made other headlines.\nFirst he was criticised for not appearing in a debate.

{"question": "Some see in this the potential for a new era in Russian-French relations. Maybe not the strategic alliance of old, but certainly an end to the modern-day chill.\nEvents have certainly moved quickly. A year ago France was in the middle of a nasty spat over warships which it was refusing to sell to Vladimir Putin.\nFor France, the Russian leader was a destabilising presence on Europe's eastern borders. EU sanctions - intended to contain Russian ambitions in Crimea and Ukraine - had full French backing.\nToday there are more pressing concerns.\nIn the wake of the Paris attacks, President Hollande had a vision of a single, united international coalition - the nations of the world working together to eradicate IS.\nRealities have since deflated that ambition. The Americans and the Russians are not going to work together any time soon. And the Turko-Russian crisis over the downed Sukhoi Russian warplane is a further complication.\nBut still, the French want as many countries on side as possible. And the Russians - by dint of their military presence in Syria - are a major player.\nAs one diplomatic official told Le Monde: \"Right now we are probably more prepared to work with the Russians than Barack Obama is.\"\nPresident Hollande has two goals in his talks with Vladimir Putin.\nFirst he wants to persuade Russia to direct its airstrikes away from the \"moderate\" Syrian opposition and onto targets belonging to IS.\nSecond, he wants a firmer understanding that Russia will not stick indefinitely behind Bashar al-Assad.\nThe French feel they have made a significant change in policy by de-prioritising the removal of the Syrian leader.\nIt took a good deal of pride-swallowing to make the concession, because until two weeks ago Paris was President Assad's greatest scourge.\nBut there is only so far that the French will go down this line. And they feel Russia should also give some slack.\nThere are a number of factors in favour of a rapprochement.\nFirst of all, Russia has itself now come face-to-face with IS terrorism - with the destruction of the tourist plane from Sharm el-Sheikh.\nThis has jolted perceptions in Moscow, for which IS is now a designated enemy.\nSecond, Russia has every interest in cultivating Paris as a new friend.\nStraight after the Paris attacks, Mr Putin ordered his military to co-ordinate with the French in the campaign against IS - an unprecedented act given that France is in Nato.\nThe Russian leader was effusive with compassion, and even sent a dog - Dobrynya - to replace Diesel the French special forces Alsatian who was killed in the raid in Saint Denis.\nIt was all very deliberate, because there is nothing the Russians would like more than to lure the French out of the American-Western orbit.\nIn the geopolitics departments of Russian universities - and some French ones too - this is regarded as a historically-determined necessity.\nFrance and Russia, after all, are two great nations lying at either end of the European continent - with a shared interest in preventing its domination either by outsiders (the US) or insiders (Germany).\nThroughout the last three centuries the two countries have been periodic allies - notably in the run-up to World War One.\nBut also President Charles de Gaulle himself - though viscerally anti-Communist - kept his distance from the Americans by flirting with the Soviet Union.\nWhat could be more natural - say Kremlin insiders - than for France to resume its natural role, triangulating between Washington and Moscow?\nBut tempting as this might sound to some in France, there is no geostrategic shift in the offing.\nFor one thing the French do not trust Vladimir Putin.\nFor another, the two countries still have opposing visions on too many key issues.\nFrance will never abandon Ukraine. And in the Middle East, France's allies are the Gulf states and Saudi Arabia - not the Shia axis backed by Russia.\nThere is a concordance of interests bringing Paris and Moscow together.

{"question": "Aviation regulator the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has imposed new restrictions on airshows in the wake of the disaster - one of the worst of its kind in recent years.\nThe Shoreham Airshow takes place annually at Shoreham Airport in West Sussex and is run by the Royal Air Force Association (RAFA).\nSome 50 aircraft, including many classic jets, were scheduled to take to the skies for display flights during the two-day event. Among them was a vintage Hawker Hunter jet, flown by pilot Andy Hill.\nEyewitnesses say the plane had just begun its flight and was performing a loop when it failed to pull out of the manoeuvre and crashed into traffic on a busy main road, the A27, at about 13:20 BST.\nFootage captured by spectators at the airshow and nearby motorists showed a large fireball engulf the area.\nA major incident was declared, with one of the paramedics describing it as a scene of \"utter devastation\".\n'Like a bomb exploding' - eyewitness accounts\nIt is not yet clear what caused the crash, but eyewitnesses said the aircraft appeared to come out of the loop manoeuvre \"too low\".\nShoreham resident Dave Penwarden, 51, saw the plane explode. \"It just didn't seem to have enough speed to come out of the loop, instead of powering out it dropped too fast and hit the ground.\"\nPilot Darren Sharp, who was a spectator at the event, told the BBC he believed the pilot had realised he was in trouble and made a \"brave decision\" to take the plane down away from the airfield where thousands of people were standing.\nFriend and fellow pilot Neil McCarthy said he believed Mr Hill had \"the experience to roll out of the manoeuvre at the top and not complete it\" if he lacked enough height.\n\"The height looked high enough to me,\" he said. \"But so many things can go wrong, there can be bird strikes, engine failure, an engine fire, there could be all sorts.\"\nThe Hawker Hunter was a mainstay of the RAF through the 1950s and early 1960s. First flown in 1951, the single-seat plane was used as a fighter, fighter-bomber for reconnaissance and for aerobatics.\nThere was also a two-seat trainer version, which served with many other air forces.\nNeil McCarthy said the precise type of aircraft was a 1950s Hawker Hunter T7, of which there were \"probably only five flying at the minute\", with Mr Hill one of only about six pilots who could fly it.\nThe RAFA says all air display arrangements, including the pilots and aircraft, must meet rigorous Civil Aviation Authority safety requirements and are regularly reviewed to ensure they provide the highest possible levels of protection.\nAndy Hill, 51, from Sandon, near Buntingford in Hertfordshire, is a former RAF instructor and British Airways pilot. He is also an experienced aerobatic stunt flyer who has performed at shows up and down the country.\nMr Hill was pulled from the burning wreckage, with multiple injuries. He was placed in a medically-induced coma and is now in a critical but stable condition at an unnamed specialist hospital.\nHis family said they were devastated and deeply saddened for the loss of life, and sent condolences to the families of those affected.\nThe flying of the Hawker Hunter jet at air displays was shared between Mr Hill and another pilot, Chris Heames, who was on holiday when the crash took place.\nHe says he was shocked and confused when he learned what had happened.\n\"I didn't quite understand how that could happen, because the airshow rules that we fly to are very stringent, and they are specifically designed to protect the public,\" he told the BBC.\nHe described Mr Hill as a top RAF pilot, the \"cream from the cream\" who had been selected to fly the Harrier.\n\"He was one of the guys who would always go out of his way to help others,\" he said. \"He worked for British Airways and in the time he had available, he helped other people learn to fly ex-military aircraft.\"\nGeorge Bacon, of the British Air Display Association, who has worked with Mr Hill, told BBC News he is an \"unbelievably experienced\" pilot, and his preparation for air displays was always \"second to none\".\nAt least 11 people died and a further 14 people were injured, four of whom were taken to hospital. Police said the death toll could continue to rise as the recovery operation progressed.\nSussex Police said the crash site is spread over about 400 yards of the A27 and extends to the adjoining airfield. All of those who died are thought to have been on the road.\nAmong them was Matt Jones, 24, a personal trainer, named by his sister Becky Jones on Facebook as one of the dead.\nTwo Worthing United footballers and schoolfriends Jacob Schilt, 23, and Matthew Grimstone, 23, who were travelling together, were also named as victims.\nOn Monday Sussex Police named Maurice Abrahams, from Brighton, as one of the victims.\nMr Abrahams' family released a tribute to the 76-year-old chauffeur, who was a former soldier and police officer, calling him a \"loved father and husband\".\nMeanwhile, the relatives of two men who remain missing following the crash have made appeals to trace them.\nDaniele Polito was in the same car as Matt Jones, according to his family.\nSussex Police has not yet officially confirmed that Mr Polito is among the dead, but posting on Facebook his sister Marina said: \"I miss you loads already little (big) bro! Keep making people smile.\"\nMs Polito said that many people loved her brother and would \"miss him loads\".\nThe other missing man, Mark Trussler, is thought to have been riding his motorbike on the A27.\nShoreham air crash: The victims\nAccording to the RAFA, the UK has among the most stringent safety requirements for air displays in the world, with both pilots and aircraft undergoing numerous checks. It said it took safety arrangements \"very seriously\".\nDozens of airshows take place across the UK every year, with the overwhelming majority passing without incident.\nHowever, there have been a number of incidents at airshows over the last decade, including some which led to fatalities - mainly to pilots. It is also the second incident at the Shoreham Airshow in recent years.\nIn September 2007, James Bond stuntman Brian Brown, 49, died when he crashed a World War Two Hurricane after carrying out an unplanned barrel roll at a re-enactment of the Battle of Britain. A report recommended the sequence of manoeuvres should be clearly specified in advance of flying displays.\nFollowing the latest disaster, the family of one of the victims has called for aerobatic air displays to be held over sea rather than land to minimise the potential for fatalities.\nThe Civil Aviation Authority has temporarily imposed new restrictions on airshows - limiting the manoeuvres of vintage jets over land to fly-pasts and banning aerobatics. It has also grounded all Hawker Hunter aircraft pending further investigations.\nPrevious UK aerial display accidents\nThe Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB), which investigates civil aircraft accidents and serious incidents within the UK, attended the scene of the crash.\nA team will continue to investigate as the recovery operation progresses. The operation to remove the wreckage of the plane began on Monday.\nTheir investigation will eventually conclude with a report analysing the circumstances and possible causes of the incident, without attributing blame, as well as offering possible recommendations about how aviation safety might be improved as a result.\nThe AAIB has asked anyone who has video or photographs of the plane in the time leading up to and including the crash to keep hold of them and await advice as to whether they may be wanted to assist with the investigation.\nThe British Aviation Display Association and the CAA have both said they will look at what lessons might need to be learned.", "answer": ["At least 11 people were killed when a Hawker Hunter jet crashed on to the A27 during a display at the Shoreham Airshow."], "label": "SUM"}

Indeed the Saudi attempt to maintain market share through maximising output and artificially keeping oil prices low appears to have backfired.\nUnable to absorb low prices for an extended period, the kingdom has lost some $180bn (Â£140bn) of currency reserves, as it has had to dig deep into its pockets to cover enormous government spending deficits.\nIn fairness, Saudi Arabia's leadership, under the guidance of Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has been remarkably open about the extent of the problems.\nIn an interview with Bloomberg magazine in April, the grim reality was laid bare by Prince Mohammed's senior financial adviser: the state was wasting up to $100bn a year in inefficient spending, backhanders and opaque business deals, he said, and would have gone broke \"by early 2017\" unless something radical was done to change course.\n72%\nof revenues come from oil\n$98bn the budget deficit in 2015\n80% increase in petrol prices last year in the country\n$2.5tn size of state-owned oil giant Aramco\n$2tn potential value of the sovereign wealth fund the Saudis are creating\nAnd so for the nation to remain solvent there was always going to have to be some financial pain - pain which would filter into the real economy and down to the vast body of Saudi nationals employed in government sectors.\nGovernment spending would need to be scaled down, and subsidies on everyday goods and services such as power, water and fuel would need to be lifted.\nLast but not least expenditure on salaries would need to be reduced, which means either people lost their jobs, or they lost their perks.\nGiven that Saudi society builds and cements social relationships around the provision of government jobs, firing people is extremely difficult without causing offence.\nThis meant that public salaries had to be cut, and in June the Saudi government set a target to reduce salary expenditure by 24bn riyals ($6.4bn; Â£4.9bn) a year by 2020.\nIt is no surprise then that on Monday evening a series of royal decrees cut salaries by as much as 20%, shrunk holiday pay and leave allowances and cut bonuses.\nThese cuts all fall broadly within the vision set out by Prince Mohammed earlier in the year.\nVision 2030 is the grand plan for restructuring the Saudi economy, diversifying away from hydrocarbon exports by encouraging Saudis to join the private sector, and privatising sections of Aramco, the oil producing behemoth that still drives Saudi income and domestic revenue.\nBut for all its lofty goals, it is unlikely that the vision can ever be fully implemented, and it is sensible to assume that Vision 2030 was never designed to be the panacea for Saudi Arabia's myriad financial woes.\nEven some leading Saudis have been open about the vision's expected level of success, insisting that it is more about changing the national Zeitgeist than radically overhauling the economy in such a short space of time.\nIf this can be achieved, and the ruling house is able to persuade its citizens to accept that the good times are over, then all should be well for the time being.\nThe al-Saud family enjoy widespread popular support in the Kingdom, and the young prince and his team have expended great energy warning that austerity is coming.\nBut it is one thing to warn about austerity, and quite another to then implement it.\nAs increasing austerity measures are introduced, Saudi Arabia's middle class looks set to join the \"squeezed middle\".\nIt is an overused Western term, but make no mistake it will be Saudi's middle earners who will struggle in the months and years ahead.\nReductions in subsidies and salary cuts will affect this middle bracket the most - in other words the people who possess just enough money to run a household and send children to school.\nSo the addition of higher bills and less income at the end of the month will put a huge amount of pressure on this important sector of the Saudi economy.\nObserving from the outside, cutting bloated public expenditure seems the right thing to do and is long overdue, but it will have social impacts that no-one can foresee at present.\nSaudi Arabia is moving into a difficult period in which its society will have to get used to leaner times, and still keep their faith that the royal family is steering the country in the right direction.\nMichael Stephens is Research Fellow for Middle East studies and Head of Rusi Qatar.

Whatever the reason, Bernie Sanders's recent criticisms of Hillary Clinton as \"unqualified\" for the presidency represent a marked escalation in the war of words between the two candidates.\nMrs Clinton's supporters are bristling at the remarks, which they consider both sexist and patently untrue, given the former secretary of state's weighty political biography.\nThe Vermont senator's point, however, is that Mrs Clinton's lengthy experience within the establishment isn't a mark in her favour, it's a flaw that makes her beholden to the special interests he has spent his campaign denouncing.\nWith what could be a decisive New York primary less than two weeks away, the battle lines are clearly forming and the rhetoric is only just starting to heat up.\nDemocrats often boast of the substantiveness of their presidential nomination contest, particularly compared to the ongoing Republican slugfest.\nThis relatively genteel atmosphere may not persist through a rough-and-tumble contest in the Empire State, however, with its tabloid media culture that trumpets every squawk and squabble. In the political pressure cooker that is New York politics, things may be about to take an ugly turn.\nThe latest row began on Wednesday when Mrs Clinton was asked if Mr Sanders was qualified to be president, after he gave a newspaper interview in which he appeared to struggle to answer some questions.\n\"I think he hadn't done his homework and he'd been talking for more than a year about doing things that he obviously hasn't really studied or understood, and that does raise a lot of questions,\" she told MSNBC's Morning Joe.\nOn Wednesday night, Bernie Sanders told a crowd of supporters at Temple University that Mrs Clinton had accused him of being unqualified.\n\"Well let me, let me just say in response to Secretary Clinton, I don't believe that she is qualified if she is, through her super PAC [fundraising committee], taking tens of millions of dollars in special interest funds,\" he said.\n\"I don't think you are qualified if you get $15 million from Wall Street through your super PAC.\"\nHe went on to list her backing of the Iraq War and her support of trade agreements as other disqualifications.

{"question": "Trouble is, the aspen tree itself doesn't like to produce seeds which makes life very difficult for everyone.\nBut last year I visited Shropshire company Forestart and helped them out with their plans to get their aspens in a seed producing mood.\nForestart harvests a billion wild tree seeds every year to grow into new trees for planting.\nYou can read a blogpost about their plans here, but here's the general gist.\nAspen trees usually reproduce by sending up suckers, thin plants that are clones of the parent tree.\nThat's no good for Forestart who need seeds to grow new aspens.\nThe last time aspens in Scotland flowered and produced seeds was twenty years ago.\nSo Robert Lee from Forestart had a plan. I helped him remove a ring of bark around each of his aspen trees.\nNot all the way around as that would kill the tree, but a strip about an inch wide round most of the trunk.\nThe idea was to simulate a beaver attack on the tree, stressing the tree out and forcing it to produce flowers and then seeds.\nWell this week I returned to see if the experiment had worked and an amazing sight greeted me, eight aspen trees all covered in catkins. It's something that you very rarely see in nature.\nRobert explained to me I'd missed the very best display and a windy day had rather done for the flowers on the male trees but overall it was a remarkable thing to see.\nIt's also really good news for Robert as if all goes to plan he and his team will be able to gather a huge volume of aspen seeds later in the year.\nCan we be sure it was our intervention that made the difference?\nWell yes, as Robert cut the bark so that some trees had branches below the exposed part of the tree.\nThose branches had no flowers, no catkins, while the rest of the tree was laden.\nIt's not totally clear why this worked, it could be the stress as Robert first though or it might be the ring of removed bark blocks the goodness in the aspen leaves from returning to the roots and instead keeps it all in the tree canopy which in turn leads to an eruption of flowers.\nThe trees themselves are healing nicely and while this won't be an annual event it is something Forestart could repeat in the future.\nMeaning more chances for people who want to plant this most wonderful of our native trees.\nThe only slight cloud on the horizon is if the whole effort is too successful, we get a lot of seeds and the local bird population treat the aspen seeds as a very expensive lunch.\nFingers crossed the siskins find something else to eat instead!", "answer": ["Aspens are one of our most beautiful native trees and there's a huge demand for seeds to grow new ones for planting."], "label": "SUM"}

More Abigail's Party than the Sex Pistols.\nI wasn't alone in wanting no more Moore.\nIn 1967, he offered the Tate Gallery \"20 or 30 major pieces\". Fellow artists were less keen, saying it was wrong to devote so much space to a single living artist (Moore had insisted his gift be on permanent display, which would have taken up a sizable chunk of the Tate's sculpture galleries).\nThe Tate declined - and the artist gave the work to a grateful Art Gallery of Ontario instead.\nThat was then.\nForty years later, I have aged, and so have Moore's sculptures. They have fared much better than me - they look terrific now.\nMaybe it's their sense of calm permanence in our superficial, super-fast world, or my romanticising of Moore's post-war vision of modernity.\nEither way, it was a pleasure to spend yesterday at his old home in Perry Green, Hertfordshire, which is now The Henry Moore Foundation.\nHe was a sincere and dedicated artist who knew he wanted to be a sculptor aged 11, had his first commissions in his teens, and went on to excel at the Leeds School of Art.\nThere he met and befriended another aspiring young sculptor called Barbara Hepworth, who, like Moore, was inspired by the Yorkshire landscape of their birth.\nHe read widely, immersed himself in art and drew on influences far and wide, from primitive African artefacts to Parisian Cubism.\nHis intellectual and technical wherewithal enabled him to successfully incorporate all these ingredients into harmonious, pleasing forms that feel both ancient and modern.\nIt's what gives his work such broad appeal and why it can be seen in hundreds of cities around the world - there is something in it for everyone.\nHis drawings of sheep and apple trees have an intensity and energy that feels kinetic. You'll see plenty of the real thing if you sit at his old oak desk in the little shed with a picture window that looks out onto the fields of sheep that frequently wander over to look at you.\nThere are some good drawings from his student days, which you can see in an exhibition opening this Saturday at the Foundation called Becoming Henry Moore.\nThere are plenty of sculptures, too, in the exhibition and dotted about the 70 acres of landscape, which the canny Moore used as a showroom for potential clients.\nThey look good.

{"question": "That is the rather startling advice in a blogpost that is being widely shared right now.\nIts author, Quincy Larson, is a software engineer, who has previously written about the importance of protecting personal data. He now fears that data could be at risk every time you cross a border.\nHis concerns were sparked by the story of Sidd Bikkannavar, an American-born Nasa engineer, who flew home from a trip to Chile last month. On arrival in Houston, he was detained by the border police and, by his own account,  put under great pressure to hand over the passcode to his smartphone, despite the fact that the device had been issued to him by Nasa.\nEventually, Bikkannavar did hand over both the phone and the passcode. It was taken away for 30 minutes and then returned, and he was free to go.\nLarson sees this as a very dangerous precedent: \"What we're seeing now is that anyone can be grabbed on their way through customs and forced to hand over the full contents of their digital life.\"\nWe also know that the new homeland security secretary, John Kelly, has talked of requiring visa applicants to hand over passwords to their social media accounts - though whether that could apply at the border too is not clear.\nAnd on Thursday, a new Republican congressman took to Twitter to announce proudly that he had introduced his first bill - to require the review  of visa applicants' social media.\nLarson predicts that a policy where travellers are asked to download the contents of their phones will soon become commonplace, not just in the United States but around the world.\nHence his advice to leave your mobile phone and laptop at home and rent devices when you get to your destination.\nWhich seems a little extreme. I can't imagine being separated from my smartphone on a flight - and I'm sure many others feel the same. So I decided to seek some advice from the UK Foreign Office and the US embassy in London.\nWas there a danger that I would be forced by border officials to unlock my phone or hand over my social media passwords?\nThe Foreign Office told me their travel advice did not cover this subject because they had not received any calls about it. But they did suggest that if I happened to be trapped in immigration at JFK airport with a border agent demanding my passcode, I could call the British embassy and arrange a lawyer.\nAs for the American embassy, well I called before lunchtime on Thursday and got a perfectly pleasant response. They would need to speak to Washington and would get back to me later about the matter of my smartphone and my Facebook and Twitter accounts.\nAs I write, it's Friday morning and I've heard nothing. Perhaps Washington has other matters on its mind. So perhaps I'd better take what I believe is known as a \"burner\" phone the next time I fly across the Atlantic.\nUpdate:\nForty-eight hours after my first enquiry, I have now received a response to my questions from the US embassy in London. Here it is:\n\"All international travellers arriving to the US are subject to US Customs & Border Protection inspection. This inspection may include electronic devices such as computers, disks, drives, tapes, mobile phones and other communication devices, cameras, music and other media players and any other electronic or digital devices.

{"question": "This could involve anything from a mortgage or loan, to applications for a credit card or a mobile phone contract.\nBut, during tough economic times, lenders are being more choosy about who they lend money to.\nSo, is there anything you can do to improve your credit rating?\nJames Jones, from credit reference agency Experian, answers some of your questions.\nQ: I have a mortgage with Northern Rock. I am trying to transfer it to another lender to get a more favourable rate.\nI took out a loan with First National in February 2005. I made regular payments of Â£120 per month for more than four years up until June 2009. Due to a change in bank accounts and address I defaulted on that date. I settled the full amount of Â£7,202 in October 2009.\nI believe due to this default I am unable to get another lender. Please advise me what I should do to repair or improve my credit ratings. R Patel.\nA: Defaults stay on a credit report for six years from the default date, so I am afraid yours will hang around until June 2015.\nDo make sure you review your report to check the default has been updated to \"satisfied\". If you want to explain on your report why the default occurred you can send a \"notice of correction\" to each of the three credit reference agencies - Experian, Equifax and Callcredit.\nThe negative impact that the default has on credit scoring will reduce over time and may eventually be outweighed by more recent positive repayment information. A reputable mortgage broker should be able to help you find a competitive deal based on your current circumstances.\nQ: I currently have a rating in the green (excellent) zone however it is towards the bottom end.\nAs I have no debts, apart from a totally up-to-date mortgage, and have never been behind with credit card or council tax, why is my rating not higher? Ronald P Macleod.\nA: You do not actually have a credit rating at all.\nEach lender you approach for credit will calculate a rating for you based on the data available to them at the time and their own lending policies.\nYou can get a score from each of the credit reference agencies to help you understand how your credit report is likely to be viewed by a typical lender, and you have clearly done this with one of the agencies.\nAn excellent score is certainly good news for you but there is always room for improvement and the agency you obtained this score from should be able to give you some custom advice based on your actual data.\nDo not forget, there are three credit reference agencies and lenders will typically use just one or two, so it is certainly worth reviewing all three credit reports from time to time. Local authorities do not currently share council tax records with the agencies, so you will not find this on your report.\nQ: Companies are quick to report to the credit reference agencies when you default on a debt. Why are they not required to similarly notify the agencies when the debt is cleared?\nI have had to take action myself to ensure that the three main agencies' records are corrected after I have settled my debts. Trevor Austin, Havant, Hampshire.\nA: Lenders are required by law to store accurate and up-to-date information with the credit reference agencies.\nInformation about live accounts is refreshed every month and the update process is the same regardless of whether an account is up to date, in arrears, just opening, or has been settled or satisfied.\nImportantly, if you check your credit report and find an account that has not been updated for some reason, you can ask the credit reference agencies to contact the lender for you. While this is done, the entry will be clearly marked as disputed, until the matter is resolved.\nQ: Does the number of times you have changed address affect your credit rating? Rosie Shaw, Cambridge.\nA: While lenders will differ in what constitutes an ideal customer - a view they express in how they calculate people's credit scores - there are some positive and negative characteristics that most will agree upon.\nOne of these is stability, which is seen very much as a positive attribute.\nStatistically speaking, people who do not tend to move home very often are less likely to miss their credit repayments.\nIn a similar way, being with the same employer and at the same bank for long periods of time suggest that you can be relied upon more than people who chop and change these relationships.\nBut please do not let this stop you moving home, getting a new job or shopping around for a better bank account. All these things are relative and if the other information connected with your application paints a positive picture then you are still likely to be seen as an attractive new customer.\nQ: I have applied for loans knowing I have a perfect credit rating and have been either offered a rate higher than the advertised rate or in some cases even turned down.\nWhen asked why this is, the response is always that the lender uses its own processes combined with information from the credit reference agencies, which is no help at all.\nIf I know that my credit history is perfect, do I have any right to appeal against the lenders decision?  I feel they are advertising one rate to get you to call them with little or no intention of ever offering the advertised rate.\nIt is particularly annoying when the search they do leaves a footprint which can then go on to affect your credit rating. Martin Torpey, York.\nA: While a great credit history will definitely support your future credit applications, lenders will also look at the information you provide on your application form plus any information they have about you already.\nThey will have their own view of what constitutes an ideal customer and I am afraid if you do not fit the bill for any reason they can turn you away.\nIndustry rules do require lenders to tell you the principle reason for refusing credit - although you sometimes need to ask the question - and, importantly, if you have been refused solely because of credit scoring you have a right to appeal and have your application reviewed by a person.\nBy law, lenders must make the attractive headline rates they advertise available to more than half of all successful applicants, but that does mean that a lot may be offered less attractive deals.\nDo not worry too much about credit search footprints. These do not usually affect credit scores unless you have collected quite a few over a short period of time and there is other information present that also paints a worrying picture.\nQ: My husband and I are both cautious about the amount we spend.  He has always been a saver and rarely purchased anything on his credit card.  I tend to use my credit card for spending and then pay off in full each month.  We are looking to buy a house next year,  but will his lack of borrowing history affect his credit score and a possible mortgage approval? C. Smithston, Trowbridge.\nA: When lenders check your credit report they look for evidence that you are a reliable customer. If you have little or no past borrowing history you may, as a result, be seen as somewhat of an unknown quantity, which will be reflected in any credit score the lender calculates.\nI suspect your husband will have some credit history - his credit card should be on there for a start - but it would certainly be sensible for you both to order and review your credit reports soon.\nYou may well be surprised when you do this. The credit-data-sharing net has widened in recent years, taking in things like current account overdraft facilities, mobile phone contracts and even some utility agreements.\nYou will find plenty of advice on the credit reference agency websites on improving your credit history, including scoring tools (which may cost extra) that will rate your current credit reports to help you both see where you stand.\nQ: I have now retired through ill health at 61. My income has dropped dramatically, so what happens to my credit rating? Currently I have no mortgage and no credit card debt; in fact no debt at all. Is it a case of lucky old me or, from a credit rating situation, am I a man who has nothing in the eyes of a credit rating company such as Experian? Larry Gee, Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset.\nA: Sorry to hear about your poor health. Your credit report will continue to reflect what credit products you have and how you are managing them.\nSo, assuming you do have some credit facilities open to you at the moment - for example, a credit card, a mobile phone contract or a mail order account - you certainly have the opportunity to maintain an excellent credit record, which will support any future applications you make.\nMost lenders use credit scoring to decide which customers to accept and they will feed other information into this too such as your income. As a result, it would be sensible to check the qualifying criteria closely before submitting future credit applications, as many do stipulate minimum income levels.\nThat way, if you do decide to apply for new credit, you can focus on suitable offers and save the time, effort and frustration of making wasted applications.\nThe opinions expressed are those of the author and are not held by the BBC unless specifically stated.

{"question": "Look around the world and every other major football club has a women's team, or plans for one. Two of the biggest, men's Champions League finalists Real Madrid and Juventus, are about to set up theirs.\nMost of those teams are fully integrated with the rest of the club and being backed financially too - a few miles from Old Trafford, for example, Manchester City's commitment to their women's side is clear.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nSouthampton are the only other Premier League side not to have an affiliated women's team, although they have just announced a new under-21 team for next season, giving a pathway for the young female players in their girls' sides - something United's girls do not have.\nLocally, nationally or globally, whichever clubs United compare themselves to, they are allowing themselves to be left behind.\nI don't understand why.\nWhen people have talked about this issue in the past, they have focused on how, with the club's vast resources and worldwide profile, a United team would help develop the women's game.\nThat is still true, but it now works the other way too - United are missing out on an easy way of engaging with their huge female fanbase, in Manchester and further afield, and promoting the importance of women in the make-up of their club.\nA women's team would do all of that. The game is growing fast and other clubs have demonstrated they believe it is a big commercial asset, at very little cost.\nWhy do United think differently?\nWhen the BBC asked United last week about the prospect of them forming a women's team, the club responded by saying: \"It is a matter that is under review and a detailed analysis is currently being undertaken.\"\nTaken in isolation, that reply gives the impression it is an issue being actively discussed by the club.\nThe problem for me with just accepting that is the case and leaving them to get on with it is that United have been saying the same thing for several years now, since 2013.\nWhoever asks them about a women's team - and many people from United fans to MPs and national newspapers have done so down the years - United's stock reply is the matter is \"under review\".\nHearing it repeated again and again makes it feel like a brush-off.\nThe BBC's request for an interview was turned down but, if I was given the chance to ask United any questions, I would like to know who is actually carrying out this review and analysis.\nWho have they been talking to since 2013, what have they found out so far, is there any evidence a review has been happening - and, crucially, when is it likely to end?\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nUnited did have a women's team until the Glazers scrapped it in 2005, with a spokesman saying \"it was not part of their core business\".\nI can actually understand why they may have made that decision at the time - United were outside the top two divisions of the old Women's Premier League and the Glazers might not have considered them a good representative of their brand.\nAlso, the profile of the women's game in the UK was a lot smaller then.\nBut that was 12 years ago and things are very different now - from the level of professionalism at the top level of the women's game here to the way it is marketed and the commercial opportunities that come with that.\nSo, if United's decision-makers are purely concerned with financial matters and still basing their views on women's football on what was happening when they ditched their women's team, they are well out of touch.\nI also wonder if the demographic of United's board has anything to do with the club's current stance.\nOf the 13 members listed on the United website, their average age is almost 50 and only one is female - Darcie Glazer Kassewitz, who is rarely seen at Old Trafford.\nUnited are not the only Premier League club whose board is predominantly male and middle-aged, but maybe their thinking boils down to the fact there is nobody in a position of power at United who believes women's football is important enough to be a proper part of the club. If they think that, why not just say it?\nThen there is the question of whether they are also scared of failing on the pitch.\nIt is only four years since Manchester City obtained a Women's Super League licence. Since then, their investment in their women's team and its integration with the men's facilities and resources, has proved a great success. They won the domestic treble last season, and reached the semi-finals of the Champions League.\nCity's men's team have finished above United in each of the past four Premier League seasons - could United be frightened that, if they had a women's team, it would be overshadowed by City too?\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nAt the moment, United do have girls' teams, up to the under-16 age group.\nThose sides have been very successful, something that is rightly trumpeted by United but, unlike the boys' sides, they are run by the Manchester United Foundation as a Regional Talent Club, not the club itself.\nThat's an important difference - the girls' teams wear United shirts but they use separate facilities and rely on separate funding and grants, only some of which comes from the club.\nWhen I talk to parents of girls who play for those teams, some of them say they don't feel a full part of the United family. I can understand why.\nBefore the Women's Super League was set up in 2014, some clubs tried running their women's team through their community arm and, with that set-up, it almost feels like they are associated with the club but being kept at arm's length.\nThankfully, things have moved on and girls' and women's teams are now far more integrated at most other Premier League clubs including Spring Series winners Chelsea, whose girls' teams are also run as a Regional Talent Club but are based at the club's main Cobham training ground.\nUnited's girls train in Eccles, nine miles away from the club's Aon Training Complex in Carrington, which is where the United boys' teams play.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nWhoever United are talking to as part of their ongoing review about a women's team, it does not appear to be anyone at the United Foundation involved in their girls' teams.\nWhen I've spoken to people who work there, it is almost a taboo subject. Nobody wants to go on the record to say they think the club needs a women's team, even if privately they are frustrated and think it is long overdue.\nAs well as the fact United are missing out financially by not having a women's team, there is a human cost too.\nThe talented local girls, who United are developing as they come through their ranks in their teams from under-8s upwards, have nowhere to go past the age of 16.\nThey have the same dream as the likes of United striker Marcus Rashford - to play professionally for their local team, who they grew up playing for and supporting.\nWomen's football is a career now but, unlike Rashford, girls cannot pursue it at United.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nEngland Under-17 goalkeeper Emily Ramsey is a United fan from Salford and had played for them since the age of eight.\nBut, now she is 16, she had to leave this summer because she did not have a team to play for, and joined Liverpool instead.\nI spoke to Emily and her mum, Kate, as part of Women's Sport Week, and Kate explained the different opportunities available to her daughter at Liverpool.\nUnited are one of the top regional talent centres for girls and Emily grew up there, and had some amazing experiences.\nBut she has gone from being the oldest and best keeper there to being part of a much bigger - and fully professional - set-up at Liverpool, where she can train and learn from England goalkeeper Siobhan Chamberlain.\nEmily is in a great position now and clearly enjoying her football with Liverpool but it must have been very hard for her to leave United. For someone in her position, it must seem like the club you love does not love you.\nNot every girl who plays for United is as lucky as Emily. Most of her former team-mates are going through a succession of trials to try to find a new club, at the same time as sitting their GCSEs.\nIf they get an offer - and they will not find out for several weeks and after several trials - they might not be able to accept it because of logistical issues - transport, travel time, expense - the sort of thing that did not affect them at United.\nIt is hard enough to make it as a professional anyway and the reality is that some of them will stop playing at a high level, and not because of a lack of ability.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nEvery year, the same problem occurs and, whether United like it or not, their lack of clarity over settling the issue is affecting younger girls too.\nAs her mum explained, when Emily joined United to play for their under-9 team, they knew there wasn't a women's team then but they were hoping there would be by the time she was old enough.\nUnited stalling over whether they will set one up has probably influenced a few other players about whether to play for their girls' teams or not. They are also hoping that the situation will change.\nThat's not fair, if there are better opportunities out there. Women's football is a career now - not a hobby - and United need to give their talented young players a route that lets them keep progressing, rather than stunting their career opportunities.\nNobody can force United to set up a women's team - not at the moment anyway.\nBut it would be different if it was stipulated that having a women's team was one of the requirements for clubs to get a licence to be a member of the men's Premier League.\nThat seems a fair suggestion to me, and would fit in with the Premier League's own commitment to equality.\nThe funding that Premier League teams would need to run a women's team would surely not be a problem, with the mind-boggling sums that clubs get just by being in the men's top flight in this country.\nI don't think United would struggle to attract sponsors for a new women's team, although the club's principal partners, Aon and Chevrolet, their kit supplier Adidas and feature film partner 20th Century Fox did not respond when asked about the issue by the BBC.\nSomething has to change, though.\nAt the moment, while boys like Rashford can grow up supporting United and dreaming of playing for the club, girls cannot.\nFor all the positive work that United do in their local community, there is nothing inclusive or equal about that.\nRachel Brown-Finnis was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.", "answer": ["I think it is shocking that in 2017 a club the size of Manchester United does not have a women's team, and what is even worse is they will not properly explain their position."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "None of the four nations is achieving any of its three key targets for A&E, cancer or routine treatments, such as knee and hip replacements.\nAll have developed plans and strategies to deal with the common challenges - rising demand, squeezes on funding and the ageing population. But each has found this winter to be particularly difficult.\nSpending: £2,057 per person\nKey fact: Just one hospital trust hit the four-hour A&E target in the first week of January.\nThe system: The NHS is split between providers of services, known as NHS trusts, and commissioners, working for clinical commissioning groups. Social care, covering care homes and help in the home, is organised by councils and is means-tested.\nThe story so far: The first week of January was the most difficult since the four-hour target was introduced in 2004.\nThe proportion of patients being treated or discharged in time fell below 78%, with nearly half of hospitals declaring major alerts because of a shortage of beds.\nAn estimated one in five patients ended up facing long delays for a bed after an emergency admission - double the normal rate - while ambulance crews reported problems handing over patients to A&E staff.\nIt comes after a gradual increase in pressures in recent years. The winters have been getting progressively worst, while the 62-day target for cancer treatment to begin following an urgent GP referral has been missed for 11 months in a row.\nThe number of people on hospital waiting lists for a routine operation has also been rising.\nNHS bosses set out a five-year vision for the NHS, which involved a greater emphasis on keeping people well in the community. But savings also have to be made - there is a £22bn target for 2020.\nThis has led to the development of 44 local plans to overhaul services - some of which involve closing hospitals and cutting staff.\nSpending: £2,125 per person\nKey fact: 63% of A&E patients were seen in four hours over the Christmas period.\nThe system: There are five integrated health and care boards that run hospitals, community services and social care. The over-75s get free care in their own home if they have high needs.\nThe story so far: Northern Ireland has some of the worst performance figures in the UK.\nDuring the Christmas period, the number of patients seen in four hours in A&E departments dropped to 63%.\nExactly the same proportion started their cancer treatment within 62 days, according to the latest statistics, while the numbers waiting longer than they should for a routine operation have almost doubled in the past four years.\nIn response to the growing pressures, ministers have already set out a new vision for the health service, which they acknowledged was at \"breaking point\".\nA 10-year plan was published in the autumn, which called for greater investment in general practice as a way of coping with the rising demands on hospitals.\nThe plan was widely criticised for its lack of detail and costings.\nIt did not mention hospital closures, but there is a general consensus that Northern Ireland has too many small units and care would be better concentrated in fewer bigger centres.\nPolitical instability in Northern Ireland, which is facing its second assembly election in less than a year, also means the budget for the next financial year has yet to be agreed.\nSpending: £2,160 per person\nKey fact: Scotland was the last nation to hits its A&E target - in July.\nThe system: The NHS is run by 14 health boards that organise hospital and community services. Social care is organised by councils with personal care - that is help with  washing and dressing - provided free in people's homes and residential care if an individual has high needs.\nThe story so far: Out of all the four nations, hospitals in Scotland seem to have fared the best.\nWeekly data shows four-hour performance in major units hovering around the 90% mark during January.\nMuch of the credit has been given to the way councils and the health service are working together.\nBudgets have been pooled, encouraging a close working relationship to help get frail patients out of hospital by providing extra rehabilitation services in the community.\nBut most of the progress has been concentrated in and around Glasgow and Edinburgh, where over a quarter of the population lives.\nArguably, this gives Scotland an advantage, as improvements in just two regions can have a significant impact on performance.\nIn terms of cancer treatment, over 87% started treatment within 62 days, according to the latest figures, below the 95% target.\nSpending: £2,084 per person\nKey fact: 81% of patients were seen in four hours in A&E during December.\nThe system: The NHS is run by seven health boards that organise hospital and community services. Social care is organised by councils, which cap the cost of home care at £60 a week.\nThe story so far: NHS Wales boss Dr Andrew Goodall has described the pressures seen this winter as \"exceptional\".\nSome hospitals have been reporting a 10% rise in admissions compared with 12 months previously, while the ambulance services said the start of the year had been the busiest on record.\nThe government invested an extra £50m to help hospitals deal with winter pressures and this paid for an extra 400 beds - the equivalent of one more district general hospital.\nBut the numbers being seen in four hours during December dropped to 81% - well below the 95% target.\nAnd the numbers waiting over 12 hours nearly hit 2,500 - a rise of two-thirds on the same period the year before.\nWales has become the first part of the UK to redefine how it deals with 999 calls.\nInstead of requiring ambulances to reach a third of calls in eight minutes, it narrowed the number of conditions needing an urgent response and now just aims for this in abut 5% of cases.\nAmbulance bosses say this has allowed the service to use its fleet more effectively, which means the most life-threatening cases are getting quicker treatment.\nOver 86% of patients given an urgent GP referral get cancer treatment within 62-days - some way short of the 95% target.\nDo you have a question about the NHS?

{"question": "Enrique is leaving after three years in charge at the Nou Camp.\nIbai Gomez hit the post for Alaves before Messi scored his 54th goal of the season with a 20-yard curler.\nTheo Hernandez bent in a free-kick to equalise, but Neymar turned in from close range and then Messi played in Paco Alcacer right on half-time.\nIt has been a disappointing season for Barcelona, who finished runners-up to Real Madrid in La Liga and were eliminated from the Champions League by Juventus in the quarter-finals.\nThey did at least restore some pride with victory over last season's second division champions in what was the final match to be played at Atletico Madrid's Vicente Calderon Stadium.\nThere were some records set along the way as Enrique's team retained the trophy, having beaten Athletic Bilbao and Sevilla in the last two finals.\nMessi, who struck the opener after exchanging passes with Neymar outside the penalty area, became the first player to score in four Copa finals since Athletic Bilbao's Telmo Zarra in 1950.\nNeymar, who forced in Barcelona's second when Messi played in Andre Gomes to cross low from the right, is the first man to score in three successive Copa finals since Ferenc Puskas, who achieved the feat with Real Madrid between 1960 and 1962.\nMessi's through pass for the third goal was sublime, and was finished calmly by Alcacer - who has been inconsistent since his move from Valencia last summer.\nThe one major worry for Barcelona was a nasty head injury to Javier Mascherano, who was carried off on a stretcher after an early collision with Marcos Llorente,\nHe suffered concussion as well as a cut to his head, and an injury to his right knee that will need further tests, the club said afterwards.", "answer": ["Lionel Messi was inspired as Barcelona beat Alaves to secure the Copa del Rey for the third year running and give coach Luis Enrique a winning send-off."], "label": "SUM"}
