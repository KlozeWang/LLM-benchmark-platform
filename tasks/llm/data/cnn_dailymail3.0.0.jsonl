{"question": "The Australian businessman charged with horrific acts of child abuse acted as the ring leader of an international paedophile ring that served Australian clients, according to investigators. Peter Gerard Scully's latest alleged victim, a 13 year-old girl, has told police she was supposed to meet one of the disgraced businessman's Australian clients and carry out lewd sex acts on camera. However, the girl told investigators plans were changed at late notice and Scully tried to sell her to a German man for the equivalent of $2924 instead, The Age reports. Peter Gerard Scully alleged operated an  international paedophile ring that served Australian clients, according to AFP investigators. Scully's alleged crimes are so heinous they have led to renewed calls to reintroduce the death penalty. Videos seized in the Philippines last week allegedly show the 13-year-old girl being forced to perform lewd acts with a baby aged one and girl toddler aged five, according to investigators. The videos shows whipping and torture along with other horrific acts, and was described by police as the most shocking child pornography that has ever been discovered in the Philippines. His alleged victim was also forced to call him 'Uncle Peter' and started working for him, after he had promised to cover her schooling costs. 'Because (he) pay a big amount that's why I had to do that,' the girl said. It is claimed Scully abused more than a dozen children in the three years he was in the Philippines, during which time he moved house frequently and assembled a team of more than four foreign accomplices and half a dozen Filipino workers in a lucrative 'pay for view' online child pornography business. Peter Gerald Scully (right) was arrested for human trafficking and child porn-related offences arising from his alleged sexual abuse of Filipino girls which was filmed and then posted online for paying clients . Reportedly, Scully slipped out of Melbourne and fled to Manila in 2011 after he allegedly scammed more than $2.68 million from 20 investors in an investment scheme. The 52-year-old was under investigation from 2009 by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission but avoided being charged with 117 fraud and deception offences, having departed Victoria. He returned to Australia  accompanied by a  Malaysian teenager named Ling in 2011, who was believed to be his 'girlfriend' before he turned her into a prostitute, associates claim. 'Because (he) pay a big amount that's why I had to do that,' his alleged victim told police investigators. The allegations emerged after the father-of-two was arrested last month after the body of a teenage girl was found buried under a house he rented in Malaybalay, Bukidnon. He was formally charged on Friday. The Age reports Scully was never charged with child sex crimes in Victoria but a number of associates claimed he had a horrific sexual history. An unnamed former business associate, who lost more than $200,000 in the fraudulent scheme, told The Age he was neither surprised about the recent charges laid against Scully. 'Does it surprise me?' the associate told The Age. 'Yes and no. The signs were always there for him, but it's gone to a dark place.' Agent Janet Francisco (right) , who was responsible for cracking the case and the rescue of several victims from Scully's house, is pictured with one of the rescued girls (left) A search warrant was issued for his arrest in 2012 but Scully remained in the Philippines, where he allegedly established a lucrative business live-streaming videos in a 'pay for view' scheme. Police alleged Scully would undertake acts in response to requests from his clients from across the globe, who paid to live-stream videos of children being tortured and sexually abused. It has sparked such an outrage in the Philippines that calls are growing daily to have him executed. The death penalty was suspended in the Philippines in 2006, but an influential conservative politician told The Sydney Morning Herald that the Australian's alleged crimes were so depraved he should be put to death. 'The Philippine government should directly and seriously address the problem of paedophilia, child exploitation and sexual abuse by supporting the move to reimpose the death penalty,' Nationalist People's Coalition MP Sherwin Gatchalian said. The remains of a 10-year-old girl were found at a home formerly rented by Scully after he was arrested . Scully avoided arrest until February 20 this year before a former partner told police that Scully had killed one of his child victims in 2013. It was after this shocking revelation that the remains of a 10-year-old girl were found at a home formerly rented by Scully. An extremely graphic and distressing account by two young girls, who survived the trauma of Scully's alleged torturous abuse, paints a horrifying picture of what at least a dozen children are alleged to have endured in his home. Cousins, going by the name of Daisy,11, and and Queenie, 10, told rappler news site about the fateful day in September 2014 when they were approached by Scully's live-in partner, Carme Ann 'Angel' Alvarez. Alvarez, who was only 17 at the time and an alleged former victim of Scully's, offered the girls food at Centrio Mall in Cagayan de Oro City and then invited them back to their house. Daisy said when they got to the house, Alvarez bathed the girls while Scully, who she referred to as the 'American', videoed them. The next morning the girls were asked to start digging a hole in the ground but had no idea why they had been asked to do the unusual task. It was then after lunch that things became even more disturbing when allegedly Scully undressed the girls and told them to kiss each other.

{"question": "(CNN)A lot of people have ventured to Paraguay over the years in search of some sort of a dream. My great-great-grandfather, Jean Bourdain, was one of them. I've looked for this mysterious ancestor before -- in Uruguay, with my younger brother Chris. We were disappointed when our trail ran cold. We were left with a cryptic reference to the news that Jean had died in Asuncion, Paraguay. Which raised the questions: \"What the hell was he doing in Paraguay?\" And \"Where is Paraguay, anyway?\" Roots: Our Journeys Home . It's certainly a country few of us know much about. Landlocked by its better-known neighbors, Paraguay is probably best known for being a hideout for escaped Nazis and for a succession of truly spectacularly lurid, out-of-a-comic-book dictatorships -- the last being the administration of Gen. Alfredo Stroessner. It's certainly a country few of us know much about. Landlocked by its better-known neighbors, Paraguay is probably best known for being a hideout for escaped Nazis and for a succession of truly spectacularly lurid, out-of-a-comic-book dictatorships -- the last being the administration of Gen. Alfredo Stroessner. When I first looked at the possibility of making a television show there, many years ago, descriptions of the country by visitors were not promising: crime, corruption, counterfeiters, failed institutions, looted banks -- in short, a backwater. I thought I'd use the dubious quest for \"The Missing Bourdain\" as the spine of a show, a framework to investigate one of the least-known nations in the Americas. My crew, looking at various storytelling structures, settled on the terrific film \"The Limey\" as a rough template. In that film, Terence Stamp, playing a just-out-of-prison career criminal, voyages to Los Angeles in search of answers after the death of his daughter. In this week's \"Parts Unknown\" episode, I explore Paraguay (and my family's past) in similar nonlinear fashion. It's an amazing-looking show. Everybody who worked on it, handcrafted it, is convinced it's some of their best work. What I found out -- about Paraguay, about my family -- surprised me.

{"question": "Fans of Chelsea, Blackburn and Wigan may be shocked to learn that unheralded striker Franco di Santo is currently one of the hottest properties in Germany's Bundesliga with Werder Bremen where he has scored 12 goals in his last 18 matches. Even more surprising is the Argentine's views on the respective merits of the two leagues. Contrary to popular belief, the 25-year-old insists players in Germany are made to train harder than their Premier League counterparts and that games are more intense and competitive in the Bundesliga. A few months ago, Di Santo's opinions might have been ridiculed but given the dismal performances of English clubs in Europe this season, it appears he may have a point. Franco di Santo is loving life in the Bundesliga with Werder Bremen after stints with three English clubs . The Argentine striker moved to England with Chelsea but also played for Blackburn and Wigan . Following Chelsea's exit against Paris Saint-Germain, it is unlikely any Premier League will be in the quarter-finals of the Champions League, with Manchester City and Arsenal both losing their first leg matches at home. In contrast, Bayern Munich are safely through to the last eight with Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen having a great chance of joining them from the Bundesliga next week. Their fourth representative Schalke gave Real Madrid an almighty scare at the Bernabeu before going out 5-4 on aggregate. 'When I came to Germany, I thought it would be a little bit less intense than the Premier League,' admitted di Santo, who signed for Bremen on a Bosman free following Wigan's relegation in 2013. 'But when I got here and felt the intensity, it was like “Wow”. Everything is fast just like in England but sometimes I feel there is more pressure here. In the English league, you have time to turn around and go against the defender face-to-face, but here it is always pressure, pressure, pressure. Di Santo says he thought it would be a little bit less intense than the Premier League but he was surprised . Di Santo says that after a career as a young player in the Premier League he finds the Bundesliga as intense . 'The other thing that is different is the kind of training. Here, we train twice-a-day two or three times a week. It was hard for me coming from English football where you sometimes have two days free in a week. 'Here it is impossible to do that. Maybe you have one day off every two weeks. The philosophy is completely different. In England, they think your body needs to rest to be fit for the game, to get it in great condition. Here it is the opposite, you have to train more. 'Sometimes it feels too much but you do feel stronger in key moments because you are training, training. When I was in England I would be a little bit more tired in the last 10 minutes. Here I feel good, so maybe for my body it is better to train!' The reputation of the Premier League has taken a nose-dive recently but Di Santo is not surprised our top clubs aren't able to dominate in the Champions League and suggests there may be a snob value towards the Bundesliga because of the dominance of Bayern Munich. The 6ft 4in centre forward has 12 goals in his last 18 games as Bremen rise up the Bundesliga table . 'I think Germany and England have the strongest two leagues but the big difference is the marketing. The Premier League has 10 years more experience in that,' he says. 'On the pitch, the Premier League is not better or quicker. 'Of course, Bayern Munich is by far the best team in Germany but it's not because the other teams are s***, it is just because they very strong. 'If Bayern came into the Premier League, they would finish top-three for sure and they could win it, why not? They have World Cup winners and players like (Arjen) Robben, (Robert) Lewandowski and (Franck) Ribery. Di Santo,  modestly for his league, believes Bayern Munich would be in the Premier League's top three . The big striker took on Chelsea and their midfield giant Nemanja Matic in pre-season. Bremen won 3-1 . 'Just because some of the other teams in Germany aren't big names, it doesn't mean they're not good. 'We played Chelsea in pre-season and beat them 3-1. OK, it was pre-season but Chelsea put out a good team and it wasn't like they were able to score 10 against us.' Di Santo, a 6ft 4in centre forward, has packed a lot of experience into his short career. He left Argentina for Chile very young and at 17 signed for Chelsea with a big reputation. It didn't quite happen for him at Stamford Bridge and he failed to score a goal for them in two seasons. 'I had to be realistic, I was competing against (Didier) Drogba, (Nicolas) Anelka, (Andriy) Shevchenko, (Claudio) Pizarro and (Salomon) Kalou for a place and they were probably better than me at the time,' he admits. 'The most time I got was 45 minutes against Aston Villa when Anelka got injured.' The presence of Didier Drogba (left), who is still Di Santo's friend, made it difficult for him to get game time . Di Santo (right) says his loan to Blackburn went well at first but then he was dropped by Sam Allardyce . Franco di Santo has hailed his Argentine international team-mate Angel di Maria as one of the top 10 players in the world. Di Maria has struggled in England, as Di Santo did, following a record £59.7million summer move to Manchester United. But di Santo insists: 'Di Maria did so well in the World Cup for Argentina, it was a shame he was injured for the final against Germany otherwise the outcome might have been different, for sure. 'He is among the top 10 players in the world. His best position is on the wing, either right or left. He is quick and skilful but some players need more time to settle into a new league than others. 'I'd say (Lionel) Messi and (Cristiano) Ronaldo are on a different planet but after them, there are five or six of around the level – Sergio Aguero, Arjen Robben, Edinson Cavani, Zlatan Ibrahimovic – and di Maria.' He went on loan to Blackburn. 'I played every single game for a half a season and did really well, but didn't score - that was my big problem. I decided to stay another six months but then the manager Sam Allardyce didn't play me any more. It was weird, from amazing to becoming very hard. But I did get a goal and assist in our local derby against Burnley and they made a DVD of the match with my face on the cover!' Ironically, it was Roberto Martinez – now in charge of England's sole Europa League survivors Everton – who helped start to turn his career around by signing him for Wigan on a permanent basis in 2010. 'It was my personal decision to leave Chelsea, I still had time on my contract but needed to play. Roberto told me I was good enough to play for Argentina, he gave me confidence. And he made me think about getting into the penalty area more. Before then, I only wanted to score pretty goals, go past a lot of players. 'Now I realise if it comes off my knee, it still counts as one goal and that has helped me.' Wigan won the FA Cup – Di Santo was an unused substitute - and were relegated in the same season, and Martinez left for Everton. He signed Arouna Kone, Antolin Alcaraz, James McCarthy and Joel Robles – but not Di Santo. 'There is no problem with that, it would have been difficult to sign so many players from Wigan,' says the player. Blackburn fans mob Di Santo after he scored against Burnley and it even earned him a space on a DVD cover . Wigan lifted the FA Cup at Wembley before being relegated, although Di Santo didn't play a single minute . Instead, the forward – who won three caps for Argentina during his time at the DW Stadium – went to Bremen in northern Germany and is finally fulfilling the promise everyone predicted in his teens. His winning goal against Freiburg last weekend lifted Bremen up to eighth, just six points of a Champions League berth. Unfortunately a booking also means he is suspended for Saturday's big match against Bayern. He still keeps in touch with old Chelsea pals like Drogba and Branislav Ivanovic and friends from Wigan like Alcaraz and Maynor Figueroa. He admits though that having not been ready for English football at 17, he would fancy a return at some point to see how the intensity and hard work in the German League have helped him develop. Wigan owner Dave Whelan gets a champagne shower from Di Santo, but they would soon part company . While Di Santo is enjoying the Bundesliga, he says he fancies a shot at 'revenge' in the Premier League . 'I am happy here really, I know I am in a league that is very competitive, one of the best in the world,' he said. 'In one way I am very happy here, I am doing well and playing in a very competitive league. But for the other side I would like to have my revenge in the English League, show what I can do with the experience I now have. It may depend on Roberto Martinez or other coaches what happens! 'If I have to stay in Germany, I am going to be happy, and for the other side, if I have to go to England, I will try to do my best to show I am better than last time.' Di Santo still has friends in England from his time there and keeps contact with a few Chelsea players .

{"question": "Sam Warburton is set to captain Wales for a record 34th time in the RBS 6 Nations showdown against Ireland in Cardiff on Saturday. Nik Simon talks to Warburton and Wales wing legend Shane Williams about the game which could decide the Six Nations Championship. Nik Simon: You'll become Wales's most-capped captain on Saturday. What's the secret? Sam Warburton: I take it with a pinch of salt because there are more games now than 30 years ago. Warren Gatland put his faith in me when I was quite young and he's stuck with me. Before I took up the role, some people said 'If someone's out of line, then you have to give it to them'. Rather than the Roy Keane approach, and as a Spurs fan, I like to compare myself to Ledley King. Sportsmail's Nik Simon speaks to Wales captain Sam Warburton and former Test winger Shane Williams . Warburton (left) is set to captain Wales for a record 34th time against Ireland in Cardiff on Saturday . Former Wales and Lions winger Williams believes his Warburton's side are still in the running for the title . Simon: Ryan Jones previously held the record, how do the two compare? Shane Williams: To be captain, you have to be well liked by the players. Warburton came in at the latter stage of my career and was much younger than me, so it was a little strange to have him as captain. But he impressed me straight away and, like Ryan, he trained hard and played hard. Simon: Wales are still in the running for the championship despite losing to England in round one. Are there shades of 2013? Warburton: It's going that way. Our experience in 2013 has given us the belief that we can do it. It was tough then because all the Wales teams previously had won a Grand Slam. Ryan sat us down and gave us the belief that we needed. We've had our one lifeline but we've got the motivation that it's still possible. Williams: Fate is always in your hands with the Six Nations, that's what makes it special. It's an open championship. Ireland are favourites to win in Cardiff but you can't write anyone off — one result can change everything. Simon: Jonathan Sexton ran the show against England. How much of a threat is he? Warburton: If I'm being honest, I didn't see the game live because I was watching Tottenham v Chelsea in the Capital One Cup final. I flicked back and forth to see the rugby score. But Johnny is a massive part of the Irish team. His attention to detail impressed me on the Lions tour and he knew every move so intricately. He deserves to be known as one of the best players in the world. Ryan Jones (centre) previously held the record for Wales's most-capped captain . Simon: How do you defend against Sexton and Conor Murray's kicking game? Williams: The game is changing and there's a massive focus on rugby league style kicks. When I saw the state of Tommy Bowe at the end last week, he had chased a lot of kicks and was very tired. It helps being six-foot plus when you're taking high balls. Dan Biggar is one of the best in the world at kicking the ball in the air, running 40 yards, and catching it. It sounds easy but it's such a big part of the game now. Simon: Who would you select in the Welsh back-three? Williams: Defensively, Leigh Halfpenny is the best full back in the world. George North is my first-choice winger because he's such a talented footballer. On the other wing I would keep Liam Williams, who's the form player in Wales. Scott Baldwin and Luke Charteris were both very good in the pack against France — especially with the 100 per cent lineout — and I wouldn't make any changes for the weekend… if it isn't broken don't fix it! Fly half Jonathan Sexton (right) has been superb for Ireland during this years's tournament . Simon: Can the Welsh half-backs match the Irish? Williams: I've been very impressed with Biggar and Rhys Webb. They've made those positions theirs at the moment and they are able to take pressure off each other through their time management and kicking games. It helps that they've been together at Ospreys and they will have to be on top of their game against Murray and Sexton, because they're the world's in-form combination. Simon: England were blitzed at the breakdown in Dublin, are you putting extra focus on that area? Warburton: Out of all the Six Nations teams I've played against, Ireland have been the most effective at the breakdown. I've not been rewarded as much at the breakdown as I was last year. I haven't made as many turnovers as I would have liked. The post-tackle stuff is always an add-on after training and Shaun Edwards always barks at us when we're doing it. It's key to our game plan. Simon: Ireland have lost just twice in Cardiff in 32 years, why are they so successful? Williams: In the nicest possible way, they take an arrogant approach and expect to win every game. They've had players like Paul O'Connell, Brian O'Driscoll and Ronan O'Gara, who have been able to win these kind of games. They have belief and mental toughness. When they're playing well, they build up confidence and are a very tough team to stop. Wales head coach Warren Gatland (centre) will be pitting his wits against fellow Kiwi Joe Schmidt this week . Simon: What's the key to countering that record? Warburton: Like every international match, there are three areas: set piece, breakdown, kicking game. If you can come out on top in two of those three then that's probably going to be the key. I think the breakdown and the kicking game will be the two key areas against Ireland. We're back at our own little nest in the Vale and we're back at home. After two wins, confidence is high. Simon: Warren Gatland vs Joe Schmidt will be an interesting coaching battle — how do the two Kiwis compare? Williams: They both stick to the game plan they want to play. Schmidt uses the players as a tool to work out how Ireland are going to play, rather than trying to fit them into a certain game-plan. Warren Gatland is very similar. Warren's got a great way with people. He gets the best out of his players by taking the mick out of them. I used to come off the field and, with a glint in his eye, he would say 'oh you were rubbish today!'. He loves the wind-up and he loves getting his players going. Schmidt is very straight down the line. He says it as it is and gets the best out of his players by being honest. They're different personalities but they're both hugely successful. Wales winger George North makes a strong carry during his side's victory against France in Paris . Simon: Wales are still in the running… How much of a World Cup confidence boost would it be to win the Six Nations? Warburton: I don't think the Six Nations will have much bearing on the World Cup. In 2011 that wasn't the case. The Six Nations didn't reflect our World Cup campaign. Last year's autumn campaign finished well for us but that didn't transfer into the first game against England. I don't think there's much of a trend with Wales. The most important period will be the three months we're together in the summer. We'll treat that like a pre-season.

{"question": "Gwyneth Paltrow's lifestyle website Goop is handing out quasi-scientific health advice again, this time to pregnant women. According to Ms Paltrow's osteopath - self-described pain expert Vicky Vlachonis, who penned 'ten ways to have a pain-free pregnancy' for Goop - expectant mothers should be careful not to 'relax their vigilance over food', and to always 'remind' themselves: 'You don’t need a ton of food to sustain your baby.' Ms Vlachonis' specific advice about what not to eat while pregnant - 'dairy, rich fatty meats, pork, peanut butter, wheat and sugar, for example' - is very much in keeping with Ms Paltrow's strict diet, so should come as no surprise to dedicated readers of the health-focused website. Scroll down for video . Pseudo-science? Gwyneth Paltrow's (left) osteopath Vicky Vlachonis (right) has written a 'ten ways to have a pain-free pregnancy' guide for Goop, in which she encourages a laundry list of food restrictions . Ms Paltrow, who has two children, Apple, ten, and Moses, eight, with estranged husband Chris Martin, has written of Ms Vlachonis in the past: 'As an osteopath, Vicky understands that a pain in the back is rarely just a pain in the back.' But while a number of the tips offered up in the piece – such as keeping calm and maintaining a healthy diet – have been welcomed by health experts, Dr. Pat Salber, an internist and the author of popular advice site, TheDoctorWeighsIn.com, tells Daily Mail Online that there is little scientific fact to back up some of Goop’s advice. 'Although not as \"sexy\" as \"anti-inflammatory diets\" and \"magical cures\", common sense approaches to diet and exercise will help you have healthy pregnancy,' she says of the website’s top tips. And when it came to Ms Vlachonic’s suggestion that pregnant women should see grapefruit as a ‘magical cure’ for morning sickness – while other foods like wheat, dairy meat and sugar should be avoided at all costs because they increase systemic inflammation – Dr Salber explained that there is very little evidence to back up any of these claims. 'I am unaware of any science behind this grapefruit recommendation, let alone any evidence to support it,' Dr Salber remarks. 'Most women find that small frequent meals of bland carbohydrates, crackers for example, help with the nausea.' Glowing: In keeping with Ms Paltrow's strict diet, Ms Vlachonic advises expectant moms avoid 'dairy, rich fatty meats, peanut butter, wheat and sugar'. Pictured, Ms Paltrow pregnant with her daughter Apple in 2004 . Ms Vlachonic also makes several references to the impact of the 'pressure' caused by the growing baby on a mother-to-be's back, and warns against lower back massages. 'Pregnant women shouldn't worry about stress on their spine and pelvis because of pregnancy,' counters Dr Salber. 'Remember women's pelvis' evolved to a different shape than men's because we become pregnant.' As for diet, Dr Salber recommends a variety of 'fruits, vegetables, whole grain cereals, and a protein source - whether meat or non-meat'. She does concur with Ms Vlachonis on her advice that pregnant women should 'watch their portion size' however, and recommends 'avoiding fast foods, overly processed foods, and sugared sodas'. One of us: While critics have dubbed her out of touch in recent years, Ms Paltrow, pictured last week in Hong Kong, recently insisted she was 'incredibly close to the common woman' In regards to recommended weight gain, Dr Salber admits: 'There is a great deal of consensus in the medical community about how much weight women should gain during pregnancy. 'It depends on whether you are normal, over, or underweight to start with.' 'Normal weight women should gain between 25-35 pounds, underweight women between 28 to 40 pounds, and overweight between 15-25 pounds. Obese women should gain slightly less, between 11-20 pounds. Other kernels of advice offered up by Ms Vlachonic in her recent Goop post include getting 12 to 14 hours of sleep a day, and plenty of time spent in the 'bathtub, a pool, or the sea.' She even helpfully suggests: 'The crowd that hangs out at the pool tend to be so kind and sweet when you’re pregnant!' Repeat offender: Goop (pictured) often comes under fire for handing out questionable health advice, not to mention outrageously expensive products . This is far from the first time Goop has been criticized for its questionable health advice. In January, Ms Paltrow came under fire for suggesting women partake in 'vaginal steams', which she said 'cleanse your uterus' and 'balance female hormone levels'. This information was slammed by doctors, some who even suggested the practice might be harmful. Just this week, Ms Paltrow defended herself in the face of long-standing criticism surrounding Goop's expensive and unattainable content. Speaking to CNN Money, she said: 'I'm incredibly close to the common woman in that I'm a woman and I'm a mother and we all are in a physical body with beating hearts with compassion and love we are all seekers. 'We all want fulfillment, we all want to live our best lives. We want to be healthy and happy and squeeze the most we can out of life. I think that's all women.'", "answer": ["Mother-of-two Gwyneth Paltrow enlisted her go-to 'pain expect', Vicky Vlachonis, to write the tips on her lifestyle website, Goop .\nWhile some of the tips, like eating healthily and keeping calm, have been welcomed by experts, others have proven less popular ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "(CNN)When American writer Avijit Roy was hacked to death on a Dhaka, Bangladesh, street in full view of horrified onlookers, blogger Washiqur Rahman doubled down. Fundamentalists were choking free thought in his secular nation, he wrote. But they couldn't silence it. His friends warned him to be careful, to watch what he posted online. But Rahman dismissed those concerns, saying his Facebook profile page didn't even bear his picture. They don't even know what I look like, he told them. On Monday, the 27-year-old Rahman fell victim to the same brazen act that killed Roy, hacked to death by two men with knives and meat cleavers just outside his house as he headed to work at a travel agency. He was so maimed -- with wounds to his head, face and neck -- that police identified him through the voter identification card he was carrying. His death was the second time in five weeks that someone was killed in Dhaka for online posts critical of Islam -- but they are hardly the only two who've paid a steep price. In the last two years, several  bloggers have died, either murdered or under mysterious circumstances. \"The despicable murder of Avijit Roy last month should have led authorities to step up protection measures for bloggers and others at risk. The killing of Washiqur Rahman today is another clear example of the Bangladeshi government's utter failure to ensure the safety of those at risk,\" said Abbas Faiz of  Amnesty International. \"How many more bloggers will have to be attacked before action is taken?\" As shocking as Rahman's death was, the reaction from some quarters was equally disturbing. On his Facebook page (for which he picked a custom URL that translates to \"unbeliever\"), Rahman had posted a picture with the hashtag #IamAvijit. After his death, someone left a comment, \"Now you are.\" Another wrote, \"I felt sorry when I first learned of your death. But then I saw what you wrote and I am not.\" On his page, Rahman reposted a cartoon depicting Prophet Mohammed from the French satire magazine Charlie Hebdo. He wished a happy birthday to author Taslima Nasreen, who was forced to flee Bangladesh due to death threats from fundamentalists. And he \"liked\" a picture of sausages wrapped in crescent rolls that someone had captioned, \"Pigs in burqas.\" Posts threatening him were numerous. \"Get ready for the afterlife,\" one person commented on one of his posts. \"See you in hell,\" said another. He used to write under the pseudonym \"Stupid Man\" on a blog but switched to posting on Facebook after 2011. On Facebook, he is credited for a series, \"Jaw-crushing answers to insulting comments of atheists.\" There, he posted questions that critics of Islam often raised and then answered them. But he paired the answers in such a way that they highlighted the contradiction within Islam. For example, one question asked what proof was there that the Quran was the word of God. The answer, \"Mohammed said in his own words that the Quran is the word of God. Since Mohammed is the messenger of Allah, his claims are true.\" He placed the question next to one that asked, \"What is the proof that Mohammed was the messenger of Allah?\" The answer, \"The Quran claims that Mohammed was the messenger of Allah. And since the Quran is God's word, its claims must be true.\" Asif Mohiuddin, a blogger who himself was wounded by machete-wielding attackers in 2013 but survived, remembered Rahman as a great satirist. \"I named him the George Carlin of Bangladesh,\" he told the International Humanist and Ethical Union. \"He wanted with all his heart, a true secular country, where everyone can practice their freedom.\" The irony is that the people who killed Rahman weren't even familiar with his writings; they were simply following orders, police said. Of the three involved in the Monday morning attack, two were quickly caught by bystanders. In confessions to police, the pair -- both students at Islamic schools -- said they didn't know what a blog was, nor had they seen Rahman's writing. They said they were acting on orders from another person who told them killing Rahman was a religious duty, Police Commissioner Biplob Kumar Sarkar told reporters. The third person is still to be apprehended. That appears to be par for the course in the killings of bloggers in Bangladesh. The only person arrested in the killing of Roy, the U.S. blogger, is Farabi Shafiur Rahman, who had called for his death in Facebook posts. There has been no conviction in the January 2013 attack on Mohiuddin. And no convictions in yet another case -- the hacking death of blogger Ahmed Rajib Haider, also in 2013. \"The Bangladeshi government must urgently establish accountability in this murder case and others,\" the Committee to Project Journalists said after Rahman's death. \"Otherwise the rest of the country's bloggers, commentators and journalists covering sensitive topics remain at grave risk of being attacked as well.\" Bloggers, unlike political parties, aren't an organized force -- and that makes them an easy target for radicals, said Imran Sarker, who heads the Blogger and Online Activists Network in Bangladesh. \"They want peace, they talk of humanity. If you strike them with stones, they don't strike back. They try to reach you with flowers,\" he said. \"So, if you want to sow fear and stifle progressive thought, they are easy to pick on.\" But the deaths -- of Rahman, of Roy, of Haider -- have emboldened the movement, rather than chill them into silence. \"No one is cowering in their homes because this is happening. Because this has been happening regularly for a long time,\" he said. \"We want to take the society forward. We know we have a lot left to accomplish.\" CNN's Omar Khan, Kunal Sehgal and Ravi Agrawal contributed to this report.", "answer": ["The 27-year-old Rahman falls victim to the same brazen act that killed Avijit Roy .\nThe deaths have emboldened the movement, an activist says ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "(CNN)It was a ding, just a \"minor concussion,\" that got Chris Borland thinking that playing football might not be worth the millions that come with being an NFL player. Borland was a rookie linebacker in his first training camp in August when he got his \"bell rung,\" he told ESPN's \"Outside The Lines.\" What did he do? He kept playing that day, and through an excellent rookie season. But the thought of the permanent damage that might be happening to him kept nagging at him. He talked to his teammates and family, read about concussions and their effects, each day coming closer to the decision that he finally announced this week. At age 24, not even yet in his prime as an NFL player, Borland told his team he was retiring because he was worried about the long-term effects of head trauma. \"I just honestly want to do what's best for my health,\" he told ESPN. \"From what I've researched and what I've experienced, I don't think it's worth the risk. ... I'm concerned that if you wait (until) you have symptoms, it's too late.\" It was after that self-described \"minor concussion\" in the preseason that Borland threw himself into researching what had happened to other football players. In the end he didn't want to leave his teammates in a bind, but, \"I know this is right for me.\" He said teammates' reactions to his retirement were mixed. One of his best friends told him that he was crazy to walk away from the money. Borland, a third-round pick from Wisconsin, had signed a nearly $3 million contract for four seasons with the San Francisco 49ers and banked a $600,000 bonus. The guys who wanted him to come back would say to the 49ers top tackler, \"That's a lot of money. Why don't you get your money and get out,\" Borland recounted to ESPN. The thought made him uncomfortable because he doesn't want to do anything just for a big paycheck. He didn't want to be wrong when it comes to this: \"Who knows how many hits are too many?\" Borland is one of a handful of players to retire young but possibly the first to retire before concussions became an issue for him. He's also now part of a shift in thinking about what repeated head injuries can do to an athlete. Reports show an increasing number of retired NFL players who have suffered concussions developed memory and cognitive issues such as dementia, Alzheimer's disease, depression and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE. \"For me, it's wanting to be proactive,\" Borland said. \"I'm concerned that if you wait (until) you have symptoms, it's too late. There are a lot of unknowns. I can't claim that 'X' will happen. \"I just want to live a long, healthy life, and I don't want to have any neurological diseases or die younger than I would otherwise.\" Passionate reactions to his decision came quickly, with many supporting him. Others say that while the move might be smart for Borland, and even encourage other players to speak out and stand up for their health, there will always be plenty of guys eager to replace players like him. Borland told ESPN that he wasn't saying no one should play football. He said youth players and their parents should do things: 1) Get informed about concussions and 2) Never let anyone play . Last August, thousands of former NFL players and their families reached a deal in a class-action suit that called for the NFL to cover the cost of concussion-related compensation, medical exams and medical research for retired players and their families. The suit alleged that the NFL deliberately misled players about scientific data that the medical community had found about the risks associated with concussions.  In July 2014, a federal judge granted preliminary approval to the landmark deal but she has yet to give final approval to the settlement. Chris Dronett was one of the plaintiffs. Her husband, former Denver Bronco Shane Dronett, committed suicide in 2009 when he was 38. After his death, scientists found evidence of CTE in his brain. Borland named three players he said made him rethink a life in the NFL. \"I've thought about what I could accomplish in football, but for me personally, when you read about Mike Webster and Dave Duerson and Ray Easterling, you read all these stories. And to be the type of player I want to be in football, I think I'd have to take on some risks that as a person I don't want to take on,\" he said. Webster had a career with the Pittsburgh Steelers and Kansas City Chiefs from 1974 to 1990. He was the first former NFL player to be diagnosed with CTE. After he retired, he was diagnosed with amnesia, dementia, depression, and bone and muscle pain. He was 50 when he died. Duerson killed himself with a gunshot to the chest. He had sent a text to his family asking that his brain be sent to Boston University School of Medicine, which was researching CTE. BU neurologists confirmed the NFL veteran had the disease. Easterling, who played eight seasons with the Atlanta Falcons, committed suicide in 2012. He apparently suffered dementia. An autopsy revealed he had CTE. Some on social media said Borland's decision made them think about former NFL linebacker Junior Seau. He was 43 when he was found dead with a gunshot wound to the chest. Friends and family members say multiple concussions were to blame for the suicide, but an initial autopsy report found no apparent brain damage. Portions of Seau's brain were sent to the National Institutes of Health, which found \"abnormalities ... that are consistent with a form\" of CTE. He will be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame this summer. The NFL has reported that in 2013, 228 concussions were diagnosed from practices and games. At least 261 were diagnosed the previous year, the league said. In its statement about Borland's retirement, Jeff Miller, the NFL's senior vice president for health and safety, said: \"We respect Chris Borland's decision and wish him all the best. Playing any sport is a personal decision. By any measure, football has never been safer and we continue to make progress with rule changes, safer tackling techniques at all levels of football, and better equipment, protocols and medical care for players.\" Miller added that the league understands there is more work to do to improve player safety. Complaints keep coming. In July of last year, ex-NFL players Christian Ballard and Gregory Westbrooks filed suit against the NFL Players Association, alleging the union withheld information about head injuries.

{"question": "Kris Boyd has insisted that even Jose Mourinho himself would have struggled to change Rangers’ fortunes if he were in charge at Ibrox. After their dismal 1-1 draw at home to Livingston on Saturday, the Govan club languish in third position in the Championship table – 24 points behind runaway leaders Hearts – and face an uphill task if they are to secure promotion via the end-of-season play-offs. However, Boyd believes that with the club now on its third manager of a farcical season, the time has come for all those on the playing staff to give themselves a brutal reality check – before they end up costing yet another man his job. Manager Stuart McCall puts Rangers, third in the Championship, through their paces in training . Boyd said it would not matter if Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho (pictured) was in charge at Ibrox . ‘We’re now on our third manager and it gets to the stage where you have to ask questions of the players,’ said Boyd, ahead of Rangers’ league meeting with Alloa on Tuesday night at Ibrox. ‘It doesn’t matter if you were to go and bring in Jose Mourinho – he would still have the same players to deal with. ‘Sometimes it can help when a new manager arrives and is looking at it from a different angle - a fresh eye. But, ultimately, it’s the same players going out on the pitch and if we’re being brutally honest, it’s us who need to get a grip. ‘We can sit and say we’ve got international players in the dressing room but, at the end of the day, we haven’t performed and two managers have lost their job because of that, so we need to start winning games of football. ‘It can’t be all the manager’s fault. That’s why we need to look ourselves in the mirror and ask if we’ve done enough. I can safely say that I don’t feel as if I have. And I’m willing to bet the majority - if not all the players - would say the same thing.

You can blame all different aspects - but it’s only excuses. We haven’t performed on the pitch and that’s the bottom line.’ After admitting recently that his second spell at Ibrox had been a failure on a personal level, with only three league goals to his name, Boyd has certainly not tried to shy away from the grim reality surrounding the club. And he believes that due to their current malaise, the fear factor has now well and truly gone for any team visiting Ibrox. He added: ‘I’ve been in the situation myself when you turn up at Ibrox or Parkhead and you’re already beaten. They might have won 4-0 or 5-0 the week before and you look around you and think: “Oh no”. ‘But that’s not the case any more. Teams are coming with confidence and have seen that we’ve been weak. Previously, it was only European teams who didn’t change their game for Rangers - but teams now aren’t worrying about us. ‘Livingston came at the weekend and got the ball down and passed it crisply.

{"question": "Man who would be President: Texas Senator Ted Cruz will reportedly announce his bid on Monday . Ted Cruz will reportedly announce his intention to run for President of the United States this Monday, which would make him the first officially declared hopeful in the 2016 election. The Texas Republican senator, who is still in his first term of Congress, is due to commit himself to a presidential campaign at a speech in Virginia next week, according to senior advisers. Aides in the Cruz camp spoke about his intentions to the Houston Chronicle, but insisted on remaining anonymous. Cruz will hope to triumph against other GOP front-runners such as Jeb Bush, Scott Walker and Rand Paul to win his party's nomination. The Chronicle reported that Cruz will announce at a convocation ceremony held at Liberty University, Virginia, the world's largest Christian university. Sketching out his campaign strategy, Cruz aides said he will hope to raise more than $40million to help him compete in the primary campaign. Cruz is said to be skipping the step of forming an 'exploratory committee', which Jeb Bush has already taken, and will directly announce the bid. He will hope that his conservative credentials will play well with the Tea Party wing of the GOP, and also rely on scooping up second and third-preference votes from less convinced voters. Though he lacks the clout of other candidates within Washington and the political establishment, strategists admit, they hope that with the voters of key states like Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, he will be able to carry the day nonetheless. However, Cruz remains an outlier in a busy Republican field. A poll earlier this month, from Quinnipiac University, gave him 6 per cent of the GOP vote. Men to beat: Jeb Bush, left, and Scott Walker, right, both command more GOP support than Cruz. Bush has formed an 'exploratory committee' for his bid, while Walker has yet to announce . In comparison, Wisconsin governor Scott Walker took 18 per cent, former Florida governor Jeb Bush won 16, with three other hopefuls still polling better than Cruz.

{"question": "A young woman, who had no luck when she posted an ad on Gumtree to find the father of her unborn son, is determined to keep searching after her baby almost died at birth. Bianca Fazey had a one-night stand with a man in Perth, Western Australia on April 23 last year and surprisingly discovered she was pregnant after being told in 2011 that she was unlikely to ever become a mum when she was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome. The 25-year-old frantically searched for the father for five months but had no success as she only knew his name was Jeremy who was from the Perth suburb of Morley. As a last-ditch attempt she decided to post the ad which only created unexpected vitriolic responses from total strangers. Two months ago, Logan Fazey was born, but he did not have an easy start to life when doctors worked for 30 minutes to resuscitate him but now the little fella is fighting fit and healthy. Now that life has returned to normal after the trauma, the graphic design student has continued to look for Logan's father, a fly-in, fly-out worker in his 20s, who she met at the Harlem Wednesdays night at Amplifier Capitol. Scroll down for video . Bianca Fazey continues to  search for Logan's father who she had a one-night stand with in April last year . Two months ago, Logan was born, but he did not have an easy start to life when doctors worked for 30 minutes to resuscitate him - pictured is the first time Bianca got to touch her son . Now the little fella is fighting fit and Bianca described Logan as 'strong, smart, happy and very, very loved' Her latest appeal has seen social media users label Bianca as an unfit mother and accuse her of telling her story just for the money. 'I'm so appalled at comments that I am a bad mother and 'god help my child'. It makes me sick that people can judge so quickly off something that is 500 words long,' she said on her Facebook page. 'Yeah I am still looking, I will probably always be looking I am very curious as to who this person is and one day Logan probably will be too. 'I don't ever expect him to come forward but if he did contact me, it would only be between us two and not the world. ' Bianca then responded to the accusations that she was paid to do the media interviews. 'For the incredibly judgemental people thinking it is all about money, I have never accepted anything for the stories, I also have my own money, I work and I study full time, I am not this drop kick you assume me to be!' she said. 'I love this beautiful boy with all my heart and I am a fantastic mother, he is strong, smart, happy and very, very loved!' She then went onto express her gratitude for the ongoing support of her family and friends in the town of Jurien Bay - 260km north of Perth. 'Not only do I have the support of my family but also this beautiful town I live in and my amazing friends, I am so appreciative of everyone who has been kind to me even if you are holding your tongue!' she said. 'I don't know if this will be the end of this story, I will continue living my life and raising Logan just as I have been, in no way is getting 15 minutes of fame a priority on my list. 'Logan, my family, our health and happiness is all that matters to me.' Bianca Fazey posted a Gumtree ad last year in an attempt to find her unborn son's father . Bianca's ad (pictured) received a barrage of hateful remarks from complete strangers . When Bianca fell pregnant all she could think about was letting the pending father know the news. 'I was at my wits end,' she told Daily Mail Australia in December. 'I tried finding him for months and felt pressured by a friend who was adamant I don't give up despite exhausting all avenues.' This when Bianca, who was so stressed that she was losing sleep, decided to post an ad on Gumtree which created a barrage of hateful responses prompting her to take to take it down. 'I stupidly put it up thinking no one would even see it but who knows what will happen, maybe I will get lucky,' she said. 'Unfortunately all I got was lots of judgement and idiots messaging me telling me they would be the father or pretending to be Jeremy.' The most offensive messages were from people saying that Bianca should have opted for a termination. 'When it was shared on the LAD bible page a lot of people made single-minded comments aimed at me, no one mentioned the guy was equally a part of me getting pregnant,' she said. 'Sometimes I want to be like one of those people on Maury Povich screaming back at the audience because they have no clue what they're booing about!' Bianca was forced to take down the post but has no regrets about deciding to have the baby . Bianca (pictured before being pregnant) never thought she could have children as she suffers from polycystic ovary syndrome . Bianca wasn't exactly shocked to be called names like a 'sl**' but it got out of control when one person lashed out saying 'kill it'. 'It was sad to see people saying I should get an abortion, those were the only comments that hurt.' 'Society is still hating on women who choose to keep pregnancy outside of a relationship,' she said. 'I was more mad at the amount of women (mums included) saying I shouldn't go through with it.' But Bianca has risen above the horrendous backlash and can't wait to meet her little man when he enters the world in two months. 'All I can say is I chose to go ahead with the pregnancy because I didn't think I could have children,' she said. 'Even though I knew this guy had disappeared I didn't want to give up my chance and I'm so grateful I didn't.' Bianca has hit out at people saying she is a 'sl**', a bad mother and has only told her story for money . Despite the fall-out from the ad - Bianca has the loving support of the people who matter most - her family and friends. 'It has changed my life and made me a happier healthier person,' she said. 'I couldn't be happier, I am looking forward to holding my little guy and raising him in a loving stable environment.' She is also looking forward to getting back into shape . 'Excited to hold him and excited to start getting back in shape!' she said. 'I hate that I'm so limited physically.' Bianca still hopes the father will come forward and become an integral part of his son's life. 'I do hope that I can find him and let him know, he can make his own choice,' she said. 'But more for the sake of the kid, when he asks questions or wants to find him I want to be prepared.' She still hopes the father will come forward and become an integral part of Logan's life .", "answer": ["Bianca Fazey had a one-night stand with a man in Perth on April 23, 2014 .\nThe 25-year-old discovered she was pregnant and tried to find the father .\nIn a desperate last ditch attempt, Bianca posted an ad on Gumtree .\nShe only knew his name was Jeremy and lived in the suburb of Morley .\nDescribed as '5,7ish', aged in his 20s, with brown hair and brown eyes .\nShe had no luck from the ad and received some disturbing responses .\nSince having her boy two months ago who almost died, she's looking for him again now that Logan is a fighting fit and healthy baby .\nBianca has now been labelled as a bad mum who told her story for money ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "Disgraced MP Eric Joyce used his taxpayer-funded credit to pay for  £450-a-night hotels during his £13,000 expenses binge, it has been revealed. The ex-Labour backbencher, who is standing down at the next election after he was convicted of headbutting a Tory MP in a Commons bar, repeatedly used his Parliamentary card to settle big bills. Many of these payments were later declared unclaimable on expenses, but his card was not blocked by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) for more than two years. He even claimed that one £896.92 bill for two nights was for a 'whole bunch of people' to stay at the four-star Park Plaza near Westminster. Disgraced MP Eric Joyce used his taxpayer-funded credit to pay for £450-a-night hotels during his £13,000 expenses binge . Mail Online's  Tom McTague revealed earlier this week that Commons expenses chiefs made the unprecedented decision to recoup the cash by deducting around £1,000 a month from his salary. But that will not clear the outstanding sum of around £10,000 before Parliament is dissolved. The Falkirk MP accepts that he made mistakes in filing claims after using his card, suggesting he was also paying for rooms for staff. However, he is disputing at least £6,000 of the debt. If he refuses to repay voluntarily the watchdog's only option will be to pursue him in the civil courts. The details emerged after Ipsa admitted it has been labelling some of Mr Joyce's hotel claims as 'not paid' in its regular disclosures - when in fact it has paid a much higher bill in full. The Falkirk MP accepts that he made mistakes in filing claims after using his card, suggesting he was also paying for rooms for staff . The watchdog confirmed he put £743 on a card to fund a three night-stay at a 'non-London' hotel, believed to be in Glasgow, in September last year. The bill was automatically paid by Ipsa. But as he is only entitled to claim up to £120 a night for hotels outside the capital, an excess of £383 was added to his debt. The published expenses records merely state that £383 was 'not paid'. He was was 'not paid' £272.33 for a non-London hotel claim in August, and £208 for another in September. Mr Joyce stayed at a prestigious Intercontinental Hotel in London in May 2013, when he appears to have broken the £150 a night limit for hotels in the capital by £203.05. He used the same group again the following month, but this time breached the ceiling by just £61.45. The issues seem to go back to at least 2012. In December of that year - 10 months after he headbutted a Tory MP during a brawl in a Commons bar - he charged £896.92 to the card for a two-night stay at a London hotel. It is understood that the claim was declared invalid because key parts of the receipt had been blacked out - although again Ipsa had already footed the cost and subsequently reported it as 'not paid'. Altogether there are dozens of hotel claims listed as either 'not paid' or 'part paid' since 2012, totalling some £4,000. Mr Joyce insisted he was using hotels booked through the parliamentary travel office, and said some bills were high because staff stayed at the same time. The £896.92 bill was for a 'whole bunch of people' to stay at the Park Plaza near Westminster, he said. 'That was all of my staff in London,' he said. 'That was essentially an error. It should have come off my (personal) card. 'They would have all been eligible (for expenses) but the parliamentary card was used rather than their cards or my card.' Mr Joyce said Ipsa had contacted him about spending in late 2013, but he heard nothing else and believed they had dropped the matter until last December. He even claimed that one £896.92 bill for two nights was for a 'whole bunch of people' to stay at the four-star Park Plaza near Westminster (pictured) 'The whole figure was only exposed in December,' he said. 'Some of these figures are legitimate debts to Ipsa but they would not discuss the rest of it.' Mr Joyce said there was a 'particular issue' with a member of staff who moved to Brighton from Scotland. He said the watchdog had signed off an arrangement where the employee worked from home but occasionally stayed at hotels in London. However, after 16 months, Ipsa decided the claims were invalid and demanded the money back, according to Mr Joyce. The MP said he had asked the watchdog's compliance officer to look again at the situation. An Ipsa spokesman said: 'MPs have a responsibility to manage their financial affairs and we publish details of all of their claims - both paid and not. 'We have consistently told the MP that he has a budget to keep to and that he is liable for any excess. We have stressed this time and again throughout the Parliament, as we do to every MP. 'We've been talking to the MP since autumn 2013 to put his financial affairs on an even keel. As you would expect, when this didn't work we escalated these conversations within Ipsa and this approach resulted in a personal assurance from the MP that he would repay the amounts due. Mr Joyce stayed at a prestigious Intercontinental Hotel in London in May 2013, when he appears to have broken the £150 a night limit for hotels in the capital by £203.05 . 'When those assurances were not followed through, we turned off his payment card in January 2015 and in February 2015 we moved to recovering money directly from his salary. We will continue to recover this money until it is repaid in full. 'This is a very unusual case. We've tried to encourage the MP to manage this situation. Clearly, this hasn't worked and we are committed to getting this money back. That is why have moved to more direct measures of recovery, including taking money straight from his pay packet.' In 2008, before Ipsa took over the system, Mr Joyce had his parliamentary expenses suspended after putting nearly £5,000 in 'non-parliamentary' travel expenses to Tokyo, Kinshasa and Nairobi on a Commons card, and then ignoring repeated demands from officials to repay. The latest situation could fuel calls for Ipsa to publish fuller, receipt-level information about MPs' spending. The watchdog has already lost two rounds of an Freedom of Information battle to avoid publishing copies of every receipt filed, a process that could potentially cost millions of pounds. The Court of Appeal is due to hear the case later this month - but no judgement is expected until after the election. In March 2013 the former Army major was banned from buying alcohol in Parliament following another bust-up. He was fined £1,500 for abusive language towards a baggage handler at Edinburgh Airport earlier this year. Mr Joyce has refused to resign his seat despite pressure from critics.

{"question": "When Cristiano Ronaldo started the year with a Ballon d'Or award nobody thought 2015 could ever turn into his annus horribilis. But since his 'Siiii!' war cry in Zurich when he collected the trophy and sent an 'I'm coming for you' message to Lionel Messi, the Real Madrid forward's fortunes have been in free-fall to the extent that the exit door that leads back to Manchester United has been opened once again. Ronaldo's agent Jorge Mendes told Spanish radio his player would go on scoring goals for Real Madrid until he is 40 as the club and the player's entourage celebrated his well-deserved gong in January. Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo sits on the Bernabeu pitch during his side's 2-0 win against Levante . The former Manchester United man endured a frustrating evening despite his side's La Liga victory . Ronaldo has a shot at goal on Sunday night but he was unable to find the back of the net . But since then he has been sent off and banned for two games; chastised by supporters for holding a birthday party through the early hours after a humiliating derby day defeat by Atletico Madrid and pledged a vow of silence after the team's defeat in the Champions League to Schalke. Manchester United have been linked with both a bold move for Gareth Bale or a romantic return for Ronaldo. Sources in Madrid now say of the two moves, it would be a bid for Ronaldo that would meet with less resistance. For all the boos and whistles for Gareth Bale from sections of the Santiago Bernabeu crowd the club president Florentino Perez is firmly behind his £86million signing and sees him as Ronaldo's heir apparent. Ronaldo is even understood to have done more to help the former Tottenham forward as he tries to push his profile and get himself on next year's Ballon d'Or podium. The request was not received with open arms. Much like Bale when he scored twice on Sunday against Levante. Gareth Bale celebrates after opening the scoring but Ronaldo appeared frustrated that he hadn't found the net . Ronaldo celebrates winning the Premier League title with Manchester United shortly before leaving in 2009 . A return to Old Trafford is not out of the question for the Portuguese superstar after a miserable start to 2015 . Real Madrid trio Ronaldo, Bale and Karim Benzema share an embrace after the Welshman's second goal . Bale, pictured with his partner Emma Rhys-Jones, is seen as the heir to Ronaldo by Florentino Perez . Ronaldo failed to celebrate his team-mate's opening goal because he was too busy lamenting his own misfortune at not scoring after failing to connect properly with a scissor kick from the edge of the six-yard area. Like the incredible sulk of old, Ronaldo could be seen throwing his arms up in the air both before and after Bale converted the rebound. Gary Lineker tweeted: 'Ronaldo's extraordinarily stroppy reaction to Bale scoring from a rebound from his effort was bizarre and unhealthy.' He was also frustrated when Bale scored his second goal getting the slightest of touches on a Ronaldo shot but enough to divert it past the Levante goalkeeper to wrap up the three points. And with those two goals for Bale and a string of misses from himself in what remained of the game, including one sitter in injury-time and a weak shot from a perfect Bale cross in the first half, Ronaldo went straight down the tunnel at full-time, not to the centre circle to applaud supporters. Ronaldo split up with his long-term girlfriend, Russian model and actress Irina Shayk, in January . Ronaldo's form has dipped since his split and Lionel Messi now has more goals than him this season . Irina accompanied Ronaldo to the FIFA Ballon d'Or awards in January 2014 but she was absent this year . Off the pitch things have gone no better for him with a split from Russian girlfriend Irina Shayk ensuring he has filled the pages of many of Spain's gossip magazines amid speculation about why the couple broke up and who his next partner will be. All this with the Clasico on the horizon – a match he would never have dreamed he would go in to on fewer goals than Messi who now has two more than his rival. Last year Ronaldo raced to a 12-goal lead over Messi who was struggling for form and fell out spectacularly with his manager Luis Enrique. Messi's relationship with his coach is now on the mend and he has scored 20 goals since the start of the year. Things change so quickly in Spanish football and Ronaldo's last three months are evidence of that. What also may have changed is the possibility that after six extraordinary seasons at the Bernabeu Ronaldo could yet find time in his record-breaking career to go back to Old Trafford for a glorious swansong.

{"question": "A British dance teacher shot dead by his son-in-law, who was also his former lover, may have molested at least four boys while running a dance school in Suffolk, it has emerged. Police have investigated four alleged victims who say they were abused in the 1980s and 1990s by Scott Rogers, who was killed in the US after becoming a local television celebrity there. Three of the men claiming that Rogers attacked them have only come forward after he was shot dead in August by Mathew Hodgkinson, who also killed himself. Investigation: Scott Rogers is accused of molesting at least four young boys while living in Britain . Rogers - known as Richard Scott-Rogers when he lived in Britain - was charged with abusing the other boy more than 20 years ago, but was cleared in 1993 after a trial. Before he moved to the US, Rogers founded the Academy of Dancing and Performing Arts in Bury St Edmunds, which was described as a 'supposedly religious cult' by the local council. Rogers allegedly held 'sleepovers' with young students, where he would 'cuddle them in their sleeping bags', according to parents. He then moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where he hosted a weekend morning TV show called Around Town, making him a minor celebrity in the area. But in August last year, Rogers, 52, was murdered by Mathew Hodgkinson, a former lover of his who had married his daughter Kimmy as part of an immigration scam. School: Rogers founded the Academy of Dancing and Performing Arts in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk in 1983 . Hodgkinson, 36, then turned the gun on himself, and died in hospital eight days later. After Rogers' death, Suffolk Police appealed for any victims to come forward, and were contacted by three men who said they were abused at the dance school in Bury St Edmunds. Killer: Rogers was shot dead in August by his son-in-law and ex-lover Mathew Hodgkinson, pictured . The force, working with officers from the Metropolitan Police's Operation Yewtree, recorded their claims and referred them to specialist agencies which support child abuse victims. However, they will not be able to take any further action because Rogers' death means the investigation has now been closed. A Suffolk Police crime report uncovered by a MailOnline freedom of information request said: 'Three new victims of child abuse reported to the Suffolk police sexual abuse by Richard Scott-Rogers. 'These historic incidents were recorded as notifiable crimes. Police provided support to these victims. There are no further lines of enquiry to complete in relation to the investigation with no other parties involvement. 'Given the suspect had died these crimes are therefore finalised in accordance with Home Office crime recording outcomes.' The three new victims brings the total number of British complainants to four, including the boy who made the original abuse claims in the 1990s. Following Rogers' death, it emerged that the authorities had recently taken away his adopted 10-year-old son and two-year-old foster son after finding out about his past. He was due to give evidence to a grand jury on the day he was killed, after police discovered that he had lied on the forms he used to apply to become a foster parent. Note: Hodgkinson left this note after killing Rogers and then shooting himself . Hodgkinson wrote an apparent suicide note found in the home he shared with his wife and father-in-law, saying: 'They broke our happy loving home. They do not get to take Scott too.' Soon after Rogers was killed, two anonymous British men appeared on a radio show and accused him of molesting them when they were young boys. One of the alleged victims, who said he met Rogers at the dance academy, claimed to have been abused from the age of 13. It is not known whether the men who made those claims are the same as the complainants who have contacted the police.", "answer": ["EXCLUSIVE: Scott Rogers was shot dead by his ex-lover  in August .\nUsed to run Suffolk dance school  where he was accused of abusing boys .\nRogers was cleared of molesting one boy in 1993 but three new victims have now come forward after his death .\nHe was facing an investigation in the U.S. at the time he was killed ."], "label": "SUM"}

She then circulated the images among her classmates before teachers became aware of the situation.

It is the second consecutive grand prix where the McLaren have been knocked out in the first phase of qualifying, but Alonso, back in the cockpit after he missed the season opener in Melbourne through injury, moved to praise the team’s improvement. Fernando Alonso posted a picture with Ron Dennis (right) and Eric Boullier (second left) on Saturday evening . Fernando Alonso failed to make it out of Q1 and will start from 18th position in Sunday's Malaysian GP . Alonso, back at the wheel of a F1 car, hailed McLaren's progress since the opening race of the season . ‘I'd say the progress we've made since Australia has been fantastic,', said Alonso. ‘We're much closer to the cars in front now but we're still under-performing and we still need to improve.' Alonso then posted a picture on Twitter of him dining out with Ron Dennis, the McLaren chairman, and team principal Eric Boullier. The snap comes after Alonso contradicted McLaren's version of events surrounding the mysterious testing crash which ruled him out of the race in Melbourne. ‘Our form today wasn't unexpected but I think our performance so far this weekend has maybe been better than I'd have anticipated before arriving here in Malaysia,' Alonso added. ‘However, the steps we're taking with the car show a lot of progress, so I'm optimistic that I won't be qualifying in Q1 for that much longer. ‘This isn't an ideal position from which to start the race, but I'm fully aware that McLaren-Honda is a long-term project.

Button, who qualified one place ahead of Alonso, echoed his team mate's sentiments and admitted that the speed at which McLaren have closed the gap on the cars in front was a good sign. ‘Before qualifying, I think we'd have hoped to be a bit closer to the cars in front of us, but this weekend has seen us take a massive step forward in performance,’ said the Briton, who finished last and two laps down on race winner Lewis Hamilton at the curtain raiser in Australia. ‘Also, I think our race pace and our consistency over a long run look like giving us a little extra. I'd like to think we could get closer to some of the cars in front tomorrow; that'll be something to look forward to. ‘There are a lot of positives to take from this weekend: we've made a big step forwards in terms of pace.

{"question": "Whether it was a Druid temple, an astronomical calendar or a centre for healing, the mystery of Stonehenge has sparked endless debate over the centuries. Now a dramatic new theory suggests that the prehistoric stone circle monument was in fact 'an ancient Mecca on stilts'. The megaliths would not have been used for ceremonies at ground level, but would instead have supported a wooden platform on which ceremonies were performed to the rotating heavens, according to new research. Scroll down for video . Historian Julian Spalding has provided a new theory on Stonehenge. He says the stones were pillars used to support a raised platform during ceremonies. As shown in this illustration, steps or a ramp would have led to the top of the platform, where figures of importance would have stood, perhaps addressing a crowd below . Julian Spalding, former director of some of the UK's leading museums, argues that the stones were foundations for a vast platform, long since lost - 'a great altar' raised up high towards the heavens and able to take the weight of hundreds of worshippers. 'It's a totally different theory which has never been put forward before,' he said. 'All the interpretations to date could be mistaken. We've been looking at Stonehenge the wrong way, from the earth, which is very much a 20th-century viewpoint. We haven't been thinking about what they were thinking about.' Part of his evidence lies in ancient civilisations worldwide. As far afield as China, Peru and Turkey, such sacred monuments were built high up, whether on manmade or natural sites, and with circular patterns possibly linked to celestial movements. 'In early times, no spiritual ceremonies would have been performed on the ground,' said Mr Spalding. No-one is exactly sure why - and how - Stonehenge was built more than 4,000 years ago. Experts have suggested it was a temple, parliament and a graveyard. Some people think the stones have healing powers, while others think they have musical properties when struck with a stone. They could have acted as a giant musical instrument to call ancient people to the monument. What is clear, is that the stones were aligned with phases of the sun. People were buried there and skeletal evidence shows that people travelled hundreds of miles to visit Stonehenge - for whatever reason. Experts think that the route was a busy one and that Stonehenge could be viewed differently from different positions. It seems that instead of being a complete barrier, the Curcus acted as a gateway to guide visitors to the stone circle. 'The Pharaoh of Egypt and the Emperor of China were always carried - as the Pope used to be… The feet of holy people were not allowed to touch the ground. We've been looking at Stonehenge from a modern, earth-bound perspective. 'All the great raised altars of the past suggest that the people who built Stonehenge would never have performed celestial ceremonies on the lowly earth… That would have been unimaginably insulting to the immortal beings, for it would have brought them down from heaven to bite the dust and tread in the dung.' However, he says the wood that would have been used for the platform has long since rotted away, leaving only the stone pillars that support it behind. Mr Spalding's museum directorships include Glasgow, which boasts world-class archaeological collections within a complex of institutions that exceed the British Museum in size. Today, he published his theories in a new book, titled Realisation: From Seeing to Understanding - The Origins of Art, published by Wilmington Square Books. It explores our ancestors' understanding of the world, offering new explanations of iconic works of art and monuments. Shown is an illustration of a Druid ceremony at Stonehenge more than 4,000 years ago. This depiction does not take the new wooden platform theory into account . Stonehenge, built in stages between 3000 and 2000 BC, is England's most famous prehistoric monument, a Unesco World Heritage site on Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire that draws more than one million annual visitors. It began as a timber circle, later made permanent with massive blocks of stone, many somehow dragged from dolerite rock in the Welsh mountains. Dolerite has a bluish tinge and is dappled with white spots that look like stars, according to Mr Spalding. 'These megaliths, weighing between two and four tons each, were transported 250 miles [400km], an extraordinary achievement in those times, which indicates that building Stonehenge was a massive communal enterprise,' he said. Sacred circle: Julian Spalding, former director of some of the UK's leading museums, argues that the stones (aerial view shown) were foundations for a vast platform, long since lost - 'a great altar' raised up high towards the heavens and able to take the weight of hundreds of worshippers . Mystery: Previously it had been thought the arrangement of the stones was solely to align with the sun (shown), but Mr Spalding's new theory suggests they had another purpose as well . He believes that ancient worshippers would have reached the giant altar by climbing curved wooden ramps or staircases, moving in the direction of the slowly circulating stars for ceremonies dedicated to, for example, a dead king's soul or midsummer and solstice celebrations. His theories have been shaped by visits to ancient sites like the stone circles of Göbekli Tepe in southern Turkey, reminiscent of Stonehenge but predating it by around 6,000 years. Only a fraction of the site has been excavated, and the purpose of its T-shaped pillars is a mystery, Spalding said: 'These must have supported some sort of raised platform.' He also points to the Nazca Lines in Peru, vast drawings apparently etched into Earth's surface more than 2,000 years ago on to a high natural plateau above the villages where they lived: 'They went up to the sacred place. These lines were a processional way, which followed the movement and shape of the stars. 'The great mystery of early man was that we all thought the world was flat. Everyone did until very recent times. All the major religious ceremonies, as the Haj still does in Mecca, always ends in a circular motion, going round and round, which imitates the stars.' Holy: 'All the major religious ceremonies, as the Haj still does in Mecca, always ends in a circular motion, going round and round, which imitates the stars,' said Mr Spalding. Shown is Mecca in Saudi Arabia during Laylat al-Qadr, on the 27th of Ramadan, one of the holiest nights of the Islamic calendar . Professor Vincent Gaffney, principal investigator on the Stonehenge Hidden Landscapes Project at Bradford University, responded with 'a fair degree of scepticism.' He said: 'At Stonehenge, there are other structures which are clearly designed to be viewed from the ground, along astronomic alignments, and you can see the sky from pretty much anywhere.' Sir Barry Cunliffe, a prehistorian and Emeritus Professor of European Archaeology, Oxford University, said: 'He could be right, but I know of no evidence to support it… There are a large number of stone circles around the country which clearly didn't have a platform on top. So why should Stonehenge?' But Aubrey Burl, an authority on prehistoric stone circles, said: 'There could be something in it. There is a possibility, of course. Anything new and worthwhile about Stonehenge is well worth looking into, but with care and consideration.' Mr Spalding also points to the Nazca Lines in Peru ('hands' design shown), vast drawings apparently etched into Earth's surface more than 2,000 years ago on to a high natural plateau above the villages where they lived, as being similar in purpose to Stonehenge . Mr Spalding is fully expecting resistance from fellow academics. He draws parallels with the 1868 discovery of magnificent prehistoric ceiling paintings in the Altamira Cave in Spain, by a geologist and archaeologist. 'He went in there and looked on the ground - because he assumed all the evidence for early man would be on the ground,' he said. 'It never occurred to him to look up. It was his young daughter who said, papa look on the ceiling.' Experts at the time denounced those paintings as forgeries. It was not until the end of the 19th century that they were accepted as genuine.", "answer": ["Historian Julian Spalding has provided a new theory on Stonehenge .\nHe says the stones were pillars used to support a raised platform .\nThis would have had people of importance upon it, with others below .\nA ramp or stairs would have led to the top of the platform .\nBut the wood has long since rotted away, leaving only the stones behind ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "A team of scientists claim it has found a way to inject people’s eyes with ‘night vision’. The research gave one volunteer the ability to see more than 164ft (50 metres) in almost total darkness for 'several hours'. By injecting his eyes with a liquid solution, he could spot people running among trees in dark conditions 100 per cent of the time, while others who hadn't been treated with the drops were successful in only a third of cases. Californian researchers have developed a liquid that enables night vision. The solution combines Chlorin e6 (Ce6) with insulin and saline. A small amount of it was dripped it into a researcher's eyes. It briefly turns the eyes dark or black before it is absorbed, seen in this image of researcher Gabriel Licina . The experiment was carried out by a group of so-called ‘biohackers’ in California called Science for the Masses. They used a solution of a substance called Chlorin e6 (Ce6), which is found in some deep-sea fish and has light-amplification properties, and is also been used in cancer treatment research. Combining Ce6 with insulin and saline, the team produced a solution that can increase vision in low light conditions. In April, researchers revealed a super-thin infrared light sensor, which could become an invaluable tool for the soldiers of the future as researchers work to develop the advance into night vision contact lenses. Created by University of Michigan researchers Ted Norris and Zhaohui Zhong, the sensor uses an atom-thin material called graphene which could be layered onto contact lenses. Graphene takes infrared rays and translates them into electrical signals. The process is similar to the way silicon chip in a digital camera work with visible light, Wired reported. 'If we integrate it with a contact lens or other wearable electronics, it expands your vision,' Zhong said. 'It provides you another way of interacting with your environment.' They note in their paper, though, that ‘the high risk of cellular toxicity from outside contaminants being absorbed through the skin make this chemical something that should only be handled with caution.’ As a result it is not advisable for people to carry out the procedure themselves at home. Russell Peake, Eye Health Condition Manager at Boots Opticians, told MailOnline that people should not attempt to recreate the experiment. 'Unless a solution has been prescribed or recommended by an optometrist, GP or pharmacist, people should not be inserting anything into their eyes,' he warned. 'An invasive eye procedure should only ever be undertaken by a trained expert in a clinical environment, as wrong use could lead to disruption or damage of the eye’s surface or tears, potentially leading to vision loss. 'Whilst the idea of \"night vision eye drops\" may seem interesting, this appears to be an unlicensed and unproven solution that has no medical approval. 'We would strongly advise against anyone trying this at home as the risks could potentially be very damaging and would advise people speak to their local optician for further information or advice.' The experiment was carried out by a group of so-called ‘biohackers’ in California called Science for the Masses. It is not advisable to try this at home. They used a solution containing Chlorin e6 (Ce6), found in some deep-sea fish and has light-amplification properties, and is also used in cancer treatment research . In the team's experiment, the liquid was dripped onto the conjunctival sacs on the eye of Gabriel Licina, one of the researchers, which carried the solution to his retinas. ‘Ce6 solution was added to the conjunctival sac via micropippette at three doses of 50μl [microlitres] into each eye,’ the researchers wrote. The solution  initially made his eyes turn black, before being absorbed in a few seconds and returning his eyes to their natural colour. 'To me, it was a quick, greenish-black blur across my vision, and then it dissolved into my eyes,' Mr Licina told Mic. However, to ‘reduce the potential for bright light exposure,’ the team covered his eyes in black contact lenses. Within an hour his vision had noticeably improved in low-light conditions. To test the effects, Mr Licina and four ‘control’ subjects who had not been given the solution were taken to a ‘darkened area’. Within an hour, Mr Licina was able to see in darkness - for several hours. In experiments he could see three times better than 'normal' eyes. After testing, Mr Licina wore sunglasses while he slept, and his eyesight in the morning seemed to return to normal. Shown is a stock image of US soldiers in Iraq in 2003 . They were then asked to identify symbols in the dark, either moving or still, and to spot individuals moving in a small grove of trees. ‘The Ce6 subject consistently recognised symbols that did not seem to be visible to the controls,’ the researchers wrote. And, in the second test: ‘The Ce6 subject identified the distant figures 100 per cent of the time, with the controls showing a 33 per cent identification rate.’ After testing, the team said that Mr Licina wore sunglasses while he slept, and his eyesight in the morning appeared to return to normal. ‘As of 20 days, there have been no noticeable effects,’ they said. While they note that more testing is needed, the initial results suggest that the technique can provide low light amplification in the human eye. ‘Further testing is need to confirm and measure the degree of improvement in health subjects,’ they concluded.", "answer": ["Solution uses Chlorin e6 (Ce6) insulin and saline to enable night vision .\nA test subject was able to see in darkness 'for several hours'\nAbility wore off the following day, with 'no noticeable effects' after 20 days .\nBut researchers warn of a high risk of cellular toxicity as a result of the solution and said chemicals should be 'handled with caution’"], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "Jerusalem (CNN)Either Benjamin Netanyahu just staged the most dramatic political comeback in Israeli history and beyond, or something was very wrong with the polls before and during the election. Polls predicted a tight race coming down to the wire, with Netanyahu in a virtual tie with his main challenger, Isaac Herzog of the Zionist Union party. Only four days before the election, polls showed Herzog taking a four-seat lead into the final weekend before the election. Exit polls on the night of the election showed Netanyahu had closed the gap. The polls suggested he was in a dead heat, with a very even split between right-wing and left-wing parties. Then came the results. Not more polls or surveys, but actual counts from the ballot boxes. Netanyahu wasn't in a fight for his political life after all. He was the clear winner, running away with the election and facing a fairly clear path to create a coalition government. Although the results are unofficial, it seems almost certain that Netanyahu will remain the Israeli prime minister. Avi Degani, a pollster, professor at Tel Aviv University and president of the Geocartography Knowledge Group, saw very different results from his own polls. He never anticipated a Zionist Union victory. Instead, he says, he always saw Likud holding a lead. The mistake that others made, according to Degani, was in the methodology. \"The Internet does not represent the state of Israel and the people of Israel,\" he said, referring to modern statistical methods. \"It represents panels, and the panels are biased strongly to the center -- Tel Aviv, better-educated, more participants in this kind of conversation. And people who are in the periphery and so on and have the stronger tendency to vote Likud, I think, are poorly represented.\" \"I have tested sometimes at the same night, doing by telephone as I do always -- and very specifically geographically, and very well-weighted and very well, having cell phones and other phones and so on -- and at the same time I did on the Internet. And I got results which are very, very different.\" But Mina Tzemach, the polling expert for CNN affiliate Channel 2 Israel, suggests Netanyahu was in a tight race the entire way and managed to close the gap \"like a magician,\" using the election polls as his final trick. \"The polls showed that they are going to lose. It gave very important information both to the public and to the politicians. Netanyahu used it,\" said Tzemach. \"Many voted what we call strategic voting. They did not vote to the party that is their first preference, but they voted for the Likud.\" Likud voters did not participate in exit polls, according to Tzemach, and that skewed the results, leading many to believe that Herzog had tied Netanyahu. \"We had ballots in an area where there are a lot of immigrants from the former Soviet Union,\" explained Tzemach. \"In these ballots, more than 30% did not participate in our polls, and they are Likud supporters.\" Another factor that may have worked in Netanyahu's favor was his Likud party cannibalizing votes from other right-wing parties. In the days before the election, Netanyahu moved to the political right, making a big push for right-wing voters to choose his party over other ideologically similar parties, such as Naftali Bennett's Jewish Home party and Avigdor Lieberman's Yisrael Beiteinu party. During the weekend before the election, Netanyahu took part in a right-wing rally in Tel Aviv's central Rabin Square. He continued his shift to the right in a series of interviews with local media leading up to the election. His most controversial statement came the day before the elections when he reversed his publicly stated position on a two-state solution. \"Anyone who is going to establish a Palestinian state, anyone who is going to evacuate territories today, is simply giving a base for attacks to the radical Islam against Israel,\" he said in a television interview. \"This is the true reality that was created here in the last few years.\" In 2009, in a speech known as the Bar Ilan speech, Netanyahu committed to negotiations for a two-state solution, saying, \"Let us begin peace negotiations immediately without prior conditions. Israel is committed to international agreements, and expects all sides to fulfill their obligations. I say to the Palestinians: We want to live with you in peace, quiet, and good neighborly relations.\" Tzemach estimates that Likud took four seats from Jewish Home and two more seats from Yachad, a party that did not receive enough votes to warrant inclusion in the Knesset, Israel's parliament. Exit polls in Israel have been wrong before. In the most recent elections in 2013, exit polls showed Yair Lapid's centrist Yesh Atid party winning between 12 and 13 seats in the Knesset. But when the final results were tallied, Lapid won 19 seats, becoming a major player in the government. This time, the unexpected surprise worked in Netanyahu's favor, turning the campaign race into an election night rout. Likud had never polled better than approximately 25 seats, but it grabbed at least 29 of the 120 seats in the Knesset, according to unofficial numbers from the Israeli election committee based on 99% of the vote. Netanyahu has worked this sort of magic once before. In the 1996 elections, early results showed the Labor Party's Shimon Peres as the winner, but as more results came in, Netanyahu eked out a victory by fewer than 1% of the votes. Degani said this election reveals the truth behind Israeli politics. \"This last election it showed very clearly that we do not have right and left. We have only right and extreme right, which is not nice sometimes. And in the right, you have the Likud mostly, and in the Likud, you have mostly Netanyahu.\"", "answer": ["Polls predicted a tight race coming down to the wire, with Netanyahu in a virtual tie with Isaac Herzog of the Zionist Union party .\nBut actual results show Netanyahu running away with the election .\nPossible causes: Poll methodology, Netanyahu's last-minute turn to the right ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew believes English football does not have enough black managers and coaches – and wants the ‘jobs for the boys’ culture out of the game. Palace face Queens Park Rangers in Saturday’s lunchtime kick-off at Selhurst Park and their manager Chris Ramsey is the only ethnic minority boss in the Barclays Premier League. Pardew wants clubs to work on encouraging ethnic minority coaches to reflect the huge variety of cultures that players in England come from, rather than employing the same “boys club” members. Palace manager Alan Pardew believes that English football isn't doing enough to include black coaches . Chris Ramsey, QPR boss, is the only black coach in the top flight - and one of just six in the Football League . Ramsey is one of just six black or ethnic minorities bosses in the Football League, along with Huddersfield Town boss Chris Powell, Brighton’s Chris Hughton, Carlisle manager Keith Curle, Leyton Orient boss Fabio Liverani and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink with Burton Albion. ‘He (Ramsey) is black, which I think is great for the Premier League,’ Pardew said. ‘It’s something that I want to promote here in terms of our coaches, because the percentage of players we have to percentage of coaches in terms of origin isn’t right.’ Palace employ just ‘three or four’ black coaches, according to Pardew and in future recruitment he plans to change that, while backing the idea of a ‘Rooney Rule’ as seen in American Football where a black coach is considered for every job. ‘I’m going to keep approaching when vacancies come up and make sure that we are covering every kind of opportunity in terms of applications that come in,’ he said. ‘It isn’t “jobs for the boys” here anymore, I’m not saying it was, but sometimes it does go like that.

We don’t have a lot of that and that’s another area that we need to promote, Asian footballers in this area because there’s a lot of huge community here. ‘We need a greater influx of Indians, Afro-Caribbeans, entering our coaching system and getting jobs, so the proportions make sense.’ Crystal Palace signed Lee Chung-yong from Bolton Wanderers during the January transfer window .", "answer": ["Alan Pardew believes there should be more non-white managers .\nThe Eagles boss is keen to see the Rooney Rule introduced into football .\nThe Rooney Rule ensures a black coach is interviewed when vacancy occurs in American Football .\nCrystal Palace take on Chris Ramsey's QPR on Saturday afternoon ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "A mother whose son suffered brain damage at birth has been awarded £5.2million after a 16-year battle with the NHS. Scotland’s highest court had twice rejected Nadine Montgomery’s claim that medical negligence caused her son’s physical disabilities. But in a landmark legal ruling seven judges of the Supreme Court in London upheld the 40-year-old mother’s claim in what was described as ‘the most significant medical negligence judgment in 30 years’. Nadine Montgomery, whose son suffers from cerebral palsy after he was starved of oxygen during birth, argued she was not properly advised on having a Cesarean by medics at NHS Lanarkshire . Mrs Montgomery expressed delight yesterday that the care of her son, Sam, who suffers from cerebral palsy, was now guaranteed. The biologist from Cumbernauld, Lanarkshire, said: ‘This is an enormous relief after a long legal fight, ensuring Sam receives the best care for the rest of his life.’ First-time mother Mrs Montgomery gave birth to her son in Bellshill Maternity Hospital, run by NHS Lanarkshire, in October 1999. The slightly-built Type 1 diabetic claimed that during her pregnancy she expressed concerns about the birth. Shoulder dystocia occurs when a baby becomes stuck during delivery, potentially starving the infant of oxygen and leading to brain defects. It is particularly common among the children of diabetes sufferers, which are often larger than typical children. Ms Montgomery, a type 1 diabetes sufferer, said the risks of natural delivery, and the prospect of having a Cesarean, were not discussed with her. Her son, Sam, suffered from shoulder dystocia during birth, and now has cerebral palsy. It is recognised that diabetic mothers can deliver larger babies, placing them at higher risk of complications, including the possibility of ‘shoulder dystocia’ where a newborn gets stuck in the pelvis. In her case, Sam’s shoulder stuck after delivery of his head. Staff released the shoulder but during a 12-minute delay he suffered oxygen deprivation. He was later diagnosed with cerebral palsy, caused by permanent brain injury at birth. Mrs Montgomery claimed that had she been advised properly, she would have opted for the alternative of a Caesarean section and Sam would have been born uninjured. But she said her obstetrician Dr Dina McLellan decided not to discuss the risks or suggest a Caesarean. At an earlier hearing, judges heard it was not Dr McLellan’s ‘practice’ to discuss the potential risks of shoulder dystocia, claiming that the risk for the baby was very small, and that Caesareans were not in the ‘maternal interests’ of women. Mrs Montgomery’s case for compensation had twice been rejected by the Court of Session in Edinburgh. But Lord Reed, who delivered the Supreme Court Justices’ decision yesterday said: ‘An adult person of sound mind is entitled to decide which, if any, of the available forms of treatment to undergo, and her consent must be obtained before treatment interfering with her bodily integrity is undertaken. Her claim for compensation was twice rejected by Scotland's highest court, but she was yesterday awarded £5.2million after London's Supreme Court overturned the ruling (file image) ‘There can be no doubt it was incumbent on Dr McLellan to advise Mrs Montgomery of the risk of shoulder dystocia if she were to have her baby by vaginal delivery, and to discuss with her the alternative of delivery by Caesarean. ‘The only conclusion we can reasonably reach is that, had she (the consultant) advised Mrs Montgomery of the risk of shoulder dystocia and discussed with her dispassionately the potential consequences, Mrs Montgomery would probably have elected to be delivered of her baby by Caesarean section. It is not in dispute that the baby would then have been born unharmed.’ A relieved Mrs Montgomery said: ‘This judgement is an enormous relief after a very long legal fight. I believe that I have a right to know of all the risks surrounding Sam's birth and I am pleased the Supreme Court has recognised that. 'I hope this means other patients will not have to go through what I have gone through. The decision will allow me to ensure Sam receives the best possible care for the rest of his life.' Dr Iain Wallace, Medical Director at NHS Lanarkshire, said: ‘Since this case, practices have changed significantly. Women are more fully informed and advised of the risks and complications of pregnancy. 'We are disappointed in the Supreme Court's decision which has applied retrospectively to the law relating to informed consent and to this case. 'We have only just received this judgement and will need time to consider it fully. We understand, however, that it materially changes the law relating to consent and we, along with other health boards in the UK, will need time to consider very carefully any potential implications for future service provision.'", "answer": ["Nadine Montgomery's son was starved of oxygen during birth in 1999 .\nThat led to brain defects meaning he now suffers from cerebral palsy .\nSaid she was not properly informed of risks and Cesarean was not offered .\nScotland's highest court twice rejected her compensation claims .\nBut yesterday London's Supreme Court overturned the earlier rulings ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "South Africa skipper AB de Villiers' accomplished showing with bat and ball helped the Proteas to a 146-run World Cup victory over the United Arab Emirates in Wellington. De Villiers underpinned South Africa's innings with a sparkling 82-ball 99 as they reached 341 for six, before taking two for 15 from three overs as the UAE were bowled out for 195 in response with 15 balls remaining. De Villiers surprisingly fell one run short of his century, but will take consolation from having smashed four sixes to take his total to 20 at this showpiece - the most at the tournament - and a record 36 in 21 World Cup matches overall. South Africa captain AB de Villiers (right) inspired his country to a comfortable win against the UAE . The explosive batsman hit 99 for the Proteas as they continued they impressive form in the World Cup . De Villers also took two wickets with the ball at the Wellington Regional Stadium on Thursday . The victory was as comfortable as the margin suggests for South Africa as the UAE slumped to a fifth defeat in as many World Cup games. The Proteas, already through to the knockout phase, set the formidable target after being asked to bat first at Westpac Stadium. De Villiers shared a 108-run fourth-wicket stand with David Miller, after Hashim Amla (12), Quinton de Kock (26) and Rilee Rossouw (43) had departed, and added a further 53 in partnership with JP Duminy. Miller was dismissed one run short of his half-century at the start of the 37th over, bowled by Mohammad Naveed, who claimed figures of three for 63. De Villiers had been let off the hook on 63 when he offered a caught-and-bowled chance trying to go down the ground to Amjad Javed, and looked set to notch his hundred only to slice a wide length ball from Kamran Shazad straight to Javed at short third man. His departure signalled the arrival of Farhaan Behardien, though, and his quick-fire 64 not out from just 31 deliveries kept the South African score racing along. Farhaan Bahardien also shone for South Africa with the bat in Wellington . UAE have lost all five of their World Cup games so far this year and were 45-3 after 12.3 overs . Duminy (23) became Naveed's third victim when he was trapped lbw, but Behardien and Vernon Philander (10 not out) took the total past 300 in an unbroken 49-run seventh-wicket stand. The UAE's long-shot chances of chasing down that total were dealt a heavy blow as they slumped to 45 for three after just 12.3 overs. Morne Morkel led the early charge for the Proteas, dismissing Andri Berenger (five) and Khurram Khan (12) as he took two for four from his first four overs, while Duminy claimed Amjad Ali's (21) wicket in between. Shaiman Anwar and Swapnil Patil put on 63 in a fourth-wicket stand that provided a brief respite, but when Anwar (39) sent Imran Tahir's delivery straight to mid-wicket they began to tumble again. Saqlain Haider (seven) replaced Anwar at the crease, but he only lasted three overs to become De Villiers' first victim of the day, before Javed (five) followed suit soon after to leave the UAE on 125 for six with 15.4 overs left. De Villiers rounded off his display with a simple catch as Naveed (17) top-edged Philander tamely to mid-wicket and the subsequent departures of Mohammad Tauqir (three) and Shazad (nought) meant the UAE fell short of completing their 50 overs. Swapnil Patil wsa the only plus point in the batting display as he passed 50 .", "answer": ["South Africa reach 341 for six off their 50 overs in Wellington .\nProteas had already sealed qualification for the next round at World Cup .\nAB de Villiers hits 99 and takes two wickets in comfortable victory ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "These candid photos reveal what life is like in a poverty-stricken village in Cuba – and how much the Caribbean island’s rural communities could benefit from an influx of American tourists. Thawing relations between the US and Cuban governments could open isolated communities to new economic opportunities once the US fully lifts its ban on trade and travel. It’s in villages such as Gabriel where visitors can experience a side of the Caribbean island that few holidaymakers bother to see. Scroll down for video . People linger outside a residence, where meat is sold at a roadside stand, in the rural village of Gabriel, Cuba . Cuba's rural communities, where there are few jobs, could benefit the most from thawing relations between the US and Cuban governments . Like in Havana, posters or paintings of revolutionary hero Che Guevara are visible everywhere in the village of Gabriel . A salesman waits for customers at his roadside stand, where customers can buy fresh vegetables and fruit from a local farm . In Gabriel, there are very few cars, workers harvest tomatoes by hand, farmers sell produce and meat at roadside stands, goods are transported by horse and buggy or tractor, and – just like in the capital of Havana – posters or paintings of revolutionary hero Che Guevara are visible everywhere. While life goes on as normal in 'the real Cuba', talks continue to take place between US and Cuban officials to restore full diplomatic relations and move towards opening trade. The old Cold War foes are claiming progress after a second round of discussions to end a half-century diplomatic freeze. Presidents Barack Obama and Raul Castro have promised to restore embassies in each other’s capitals, although a few hurdles remain, including Cuba’s place on the US state sponsor of terrorism blacklist. Thawing relations between the US and Cuban governments could open isolated communities to new economic opportunities . It is likely that with economic sanctions lifted, Cuba will change forever, and there are fears it will lose some of its unique identity . In Gabriel, Cuba, there are very few cars, workers harvest tomatoes by hand, and goods are transported by horse and buggy or tractor . The US is planning to ease travel and trade restrictions with Cuba, a former Cold War foe, after agreeing to restore ties severed since 1961 . While most US tourists will likely stick to Havana or all-inclusive resorts on the sea once the ban on travel is lifted, rural villages who do welcome foreigners are not prepared to handle them in large numbers. Many lack running water, suitable accommodation and modern facilities, including toilets. With Cuba poised to open itself up to a massive market for holidaymakers, tourists from outside the US are being warned that if they want to see 'the real Cuba' they should book their trips now, before the Caribbean country becomes 'Americanised'. Rural villages are not prepared to handle foreign tourists in large numbers, as there are very few modern facilities . With many issues unresolved, the US is hoping to reach agreement on reopening embassies in time for a regional summit in Panama in April . Some travel experts are encouraging tourists to visit Cuba sooner rather than later if they want to see unadulterated local culture . In rural Cuba, villagers make a living by selling vegetables, fruit and meat from local farms . The number of tourists visiting Havana has seen a steady increase following the normalisation of Cuba-US relations last year . While the landmark thaw in relations signals a positive future for Cuba, travellers looking to explore the 'timewarp' nation are being urged to go before it changes forever. TravelSupermarket travel expert Bob Atkinson recently told MailOnline Travel: 'It really is a unique place to visit, and once it becomes fully open to the Americans, they will without doubt pile in. 'Havana was seen as a party destination for Americans years ago, such was its close proximity to Florida. Presidents Barack Obama and Raul Castro have promised to restore embassies in each other’s capitals, although a few hurdles remain . One of the biggest hurdles is Cuba's place on a US list of state sponsors of terrorism, from which Cuba is pushing to be removed . Tourists on a double-decker bus take in the sights, including a local football match, during a tour of Havana, Cuba's capital . If the US lifts its restrictions on travel and trade, one of the biggest draws for American tourists could be Major League Baseball games . 'However you look at it, opening up to the Americans will change the way it feels and I think this will be to the detriment to the culture and heritage of the place. If restrictions are lifted and Cuba becomes a popular destination for US tourists once again, one of the biggest draws could be the countries’ shared love of baseball. Major League Baseball is considering playing spring exhibition games on the baseball-mad island nation, where American teams played before Fidel Castro came to power. Major league teams regularly held spring training camps in Cuba in the 1940s and ‘50s, and there have been discussions to bring them back to the country once the governments officially end the diplomatic freeze.", "answer": ["In village of Gabriel, farmers sell produce and meat at roadside stands, and there are very few cars .\nLike in Havana, paintings or posters of revolutionary hero Che Guevara are visible everywhere .\nUS and Cuban government officials continue to hold talks to end half-century diplomatic freeze ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "Vicarage Road was awash with emotion on Saturday afternoon as Watford performed a show of solidarity for Nic Cruwys, the fan left fighting for his life in hospital. Cruwys was shockingly set upon by a group thugs on his way back to Wolverhampton train station from Molineux last week and is in a critical condition. The 44-year-old had been in the Midlands to watch his side draw 2-2 in the Championship. Watford’s players warmed up with ‘For Nic’ T-shirts in show of support for injured fan Nic Cruwys . Watford performed a show of solidarity for Mr Cruwys, the fan left fighting for his life in hospital . Watford’s players warmed up with t-shirts reading ‘For Nic’ and the club dedicated their matchday programme to him with the message ‘thinking of Nic - showing the strength of the Watford FC family’. Members of Nic’s family were given a rousing reception on the pitch before the game against Reading, with all four sides of the stadium on its feet in applause - then mirrored just before the break. A banner behind one goal simply read: ‘Best wishes Nic “Moo”, we are all thinking of you... From your Watford FC family.’ Two teenagers, 13 and 18, have been arrested and bailed until April after the attack. A heartfelt message of support for Mr Cruwys was displayed on a large banner before the game . Mr Cruwys was in a critical but stable condition at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham on Saturday . Chief executive Scott Duxbury wrote in the programme to address the ‘horrendous events’ of seven days ago. ‘Everyone who works for Watford has had Nic Cruwys in their thoughts since last Saturday’s sick and unprovoked attack,’ Duxbury said. ‘I’d like all Watford fans to be aware just what a positive impact the support you’ve shown towards Nic and his family has had. An online appeal to raise funds to help Mr Cruwys, set up by a Wolves fan, has raised more than £25,000. A fund set up to raise money for the Watford fan has raised more than £25,000 to date . Troy Deeney helped Watford secure a 4-1 victory against Reading on Saturday . ‘Nic was simply enjoying a day out at an away match with his friends when he suffered a callous, calculated and unprovoked assault. Any one of us coming away from the stadium could have suffered as Nic has. ‘You’ll no doubt be aware of the online fund set up to benefit Nic and his family. The total raised is now £25,000 and, while money cannot wipe away what has happened, I am aware that the gesture has been extremely well received. ‘In closing I find it very difficult to come to terms with what has happened. I can only take solace from the fact I know everyone connected with this football club will do everything to help and support Nic.’ Sixteen-year-old Ollie Floyd, a Wolves supporter, whose idea it was to start the fund was interviewed and given a warm reception on the pitch at half-time.

{"question": "So now we know. Not only can Rory McIlroy play golf better than anyone else, he can throw clubs further than anyone else as well. With perhaps the most extraordinary act of frustration we’ve seen on a golf course in recent years, the Northern Irishman left no-one in any doubt as to what he thinks about his current erratic form. After a wild three iron plunged into the water at the par five 8th on Friday, the world No 1 hurled his club 60 or 70 yards into the adjacent hazard. World No 1 Rory McIlroy threw a club into the water in frustration after more erratic play on Friday . McIlroy swings and releases his club after finding the water during the WGC-Cadillac Championship . The Northern Irishman watches as his club soars into the air and towards the lake . The 25-year-old's club makes a splash as it lands in the water on Friday afternoon . Maybe when he’s finished breaking golfing records he will take up the javelin. Of course it was conduct terribly unbecoming and will lead to an inevitable fine. But the vast majority of golfers will have recognised what was going on. ‘It was just heat of the moment stuff and not one of my proudest moments,’ admitted McIlroy. ‘I’ve never done anything like that before. I probably wouldn’t have done it here but I knew I didn’t need a three iron for the rest of my round. So I thought: \"Yeah, why not?”’ His playing partner knew exactly what was going on. Henrik Stenson is a prince off the golf course but on it the Swede has broken more than his fair share of clubs in anger. ‘It was an impressive release from Rory,’ he said, smiling. ‘You know, for a small guy he’s got a strong throw and he had good speed on that one.’ Worried perhaps that one or two of the American press might not get the joke, he added: ’Be nice to him. He’s a good guy.’ For those who would rather bounce up and down with righteous indignation, here’s what the great American amateur Bobby Jones said almost 100 years ago: ‘There are some emotions that simply cannot be endured with a golf club in your hands.’ The game might be unrecognisable from Jones’s day but in that regard it remains the same. Of more concern for McIlroy followers is what it says about his current state of mind. Under Plan A, he’s only got six more competitive rounds at most to play before the Masters, when he will be trying to complete the career grand slam. Clearly, his game is not where he wants it to be but at least he’s not lost his sense of humour. McIlroy takes his tee shot on the seventh hole of the second round in Florida . McIlroy missed the cut in the Honda Classic last week and struggled to an opening 73 at Doral . Asked what will he do for a three iron on Saturday, he replied: ‘There’s one on the way, but I’m not sure if it’s courtesy of Nike or a scuba diving team.’ The curious thing was he seemed to play better with 13 clubs than 14. This was McEnroe-esque rather than McIlroy. With the frustration no longer pent-up, he made a birdie with his second ball at the 8th, before birdieing the 10th and 12th holes. Another birdie at the 17th meant he finished with a 70 and, on one under for the event, stands on the fringes of the top ten. ‘What’s annoying me is there’s no sign on the range of the sort of shot I hit on the 8th,’ he said. ‘So it’s a little bit of a mental thing and a bit physical and something I need to work on.’ McIlroy is eight shots off the lead held by American JB Holmes, who double-bogeyed his last hole to give everyone a break. He is now just two shots ahead of fellow American Ryan Moore, with Adam Scott lurking in third place, a further shot behind. Then come Stenson and Masters champion Bubba Watson at five adrift. Scott is not only playing his first competitive round for three months, he is also using a short putter in competition for the first time in four years. You could say it is working. So far he has had 30 putts inside 12ft….and holed 28 of them. Welshman Jamie Donaldson, runner-up in this event last year, is seven behind after a 72. Alongside McIlroy on one under is Lee Westwood, who is playing in his 50th WGC – the first man to reach that milestone since the four events to enjoy such status were conceived in 1999.", "answer": ["Rory McIlroy competing in Cadillac Championship at Trump National Doral .\nThe world No 1 got frustrated in the second round after finding the water .\nAfter losing his ball in the lake, McIlroy threw his club in too .\nThe Northern Irishman was level par for his round, and one-over in total ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "A young Australian woman is spearheading a global campaign petitioning Facebook to remove 'body shaming' emoticons and status options from the social media site. Rebecca Guzelian, along with seven other women around the world, has partnered with Endangered Bodies, an international movement challenging body image standards, to launch a campaign to remove the ‘I feel fat’ and ‘I feel ugly’ emoticons from the social media site. Ms Guzelian, a counsellor and intern psychologist, is one of over ten thousand people to back the 'Fat is not a feeling' petition, and claims that the options perpetuate and normalise body shaming, especially in young people. Scroll down for video . Rebecca Guzelian has partnered with Endangered Bodies in the 'Fat is not a feeling' campaign . Ms Guzelian launched the Australian 'Fat is not a feeling' petition and shared her personal experiences . 'When I first heard that the 'fat' and 'ugly' feelings options were made available for people to select on Facebook, I was shocked and definitely felt compelled to work alongside Endangered Bodies to do something about it,' Ms Guzelian told Daily Mail Australia. Endangered Bodies has been petitioning Facebook to remove the options from their site, and has partnered with the women to start national petitions to remove the options from all forms of the website. Women from the UK, Ireland, the US, Germany, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, and Australia have partnered together to post their personal stories and experience with body shaming to promote the campaign, which has garnered  thousands of signatures in just a few days. Facebook has long held itself up as a community driven social media site, and over the ten years since it's inception, has introduced different features to reflect the habits of the millions of people on the site. The 'fat' and 'ugly' emoticons were first introduced in 2013 as part of the 'feelings' feature for status updates, along with almost 100 other emoticons that can be individualised to reflect a user's mood. Ms Guzelian said the emoticons normalise body shaming and encourages young people to use the words publicly to speak negatively about themselves. 'Encouraging this kind of 'fat talk' is not okay – and that’s exactly what Facebook is doing by offering these words as options,' Ms Guzelian said. Eight women have partnered with Endangered Bodies, a movement challenging body image standards . The eight women have all started national petitions to remove the options from all forms of the website . Psychologist Sarah McMahon from Endangered Bodies Australia, along with her colleagues from around the world, have been petitioning the social media giant since the status options were introduced but have received no response. 'Facebook has not been listening. Not only do these features remain as emoji selections, Facebook have not addressed the critcisms that this plays in contributing to culture of body shaming,' Ms McMahon said. 'This is despite the fact Facebook claims that one of their core values is to build social value- which in this instance they are not doing. This is particularly concerning when research demonstrates that Facebook use is already associated with increased risk of eating disorders, weight concern and anxiety,' she said. '\"Feeling fat\" was once the language of clinical eating disorders and it is now normative in our society. It is well documented that \"fat talk\", as using such terms is known, perpetuates body image issues and body shame rather than reduce it. Women from the UK, Ireland, the US, Germany, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, and Australia are campaigners . Endangered Bodies has been petitioning the social media giant since the status options were introduced . Over 10,000 people have signed the 'Fat is not a feeling' petition on Change.org . Ms Guzelian said that she and the other women hope that the social media giant will recognise that the emoticons are contributing to body shaming issues, and that it is a concern for Australians. The petition explains that '‘fat’ and ‘ugly’ are adjectives. They describe physical characteristics, NOT feelings.' 'Having these word choices completely normalises using derogatory descriptive terms in the place of real feelings. What’s worse is that these adjectives are judgemental and forced on us by society to make women (and increasingly men) feel negatively about their otherwise healthy bodies,' the petition says. 'When someone says “I feel fat” what they’re really communicating is that they feel unattractive, unhappy, embarrassed and insecure about their body. And believe it or not, these feelings are most commonly a response to the unrealistic, culturally promoted ideals of thinness and beauty that are shoved in our faces every single day.' Ms Guzelian, who works as a counsellor at The Butterfly Foundation, Australia's leading body supporting people who struggle with eating disorders and body image problems, said that young people are becoming increasingly obsessed with how they look. 'For young people, who are on Facebook from nine, ten, 11 years of age, having a huge platform like this tell them it's normal to speak about themselves like that is a huge issue.' 'Facebook encourages people to focus on and scrutinise the way they look, so as to present the best version of themselves in the online world. Doing this really places an extreme focus on the external, instead of the internal,' she said. The 'fat' and 'ugly' emoticons were first introduced in 2013 as part of the 'feelings' feature for status updates . Ms Guzelian said  that the emoticons are contributing to body shaming issues . The petition explains that '‘fat’ and ‘ugly’ are adjectives. They describe physical characteristics, NOT feelings' 'We begin to measure our worth by the way that we look – because let’s face it, Facebook isn’t the place that we are all posting about the important reasons why we are great, wonderful valuable and worthy people on the inside.' Ms Guzelian said that the campaign was as much about encouraging a positive discussion about body image as it was a bid to have the emoticons removed. 'There are things everywhere in the world that tells us to be ashamed of how we look, and why we feel bad about ourselves,' she said. 'There are cues everywhere around us, guiding us down that path and if we can prick up our ears and take notice, then we can choose to see ourselves and others in a different light.'

{"question": "Two New Jersey drug addicts who were arrested last year after the woman's baby nearly died after eating heroin have avoided prison time. Mark Tomat, 26, this week admitted to a judge that he and his girlfriend Tara Bradbury, 23, took heroin at her home in Wyckoff on Valentine's Day 2014. Last month, Bradbury - who comes from an upper-middle class New Jersey community - gave birth to a second child while she was being treated at an intensive program - to ensure she didn't take any more drugs to harm her unborn son. Mark Tomat, 26, admitted to a judge that he and his girlfriend Tara Bradbury, 23, took heroin at her home in Wyckoff last February. Bradbury's nine-month-old baby accidentally ingested the drug . Tomat said he left the narcotic lying around the house and learned Bradbury's baby had ingested the drug about an hour after he left  that night. Police found text messages between the two in which they talked about a plan to deny that they knew the baby had eaten heroin - so as not to incriminate themselves. Paramedics responding to a 911 call found the infant unresponsive and with a bruised forehead. The baby recovered after it was administered Narcan, an antidote for heroin overdose. Bradbury, who is from the upper-middle-class community Indian Hills, was sentenced to drug court, which means she will be provided with ongoing treatment in an intensely supervised drug treatment program. On February 27 she delivered the couple's first child together - her second. Bradbury voluntarily entered Bergen County Jail earlier that month so that she could receive proper medical attention in the weeks leading up to her due date, according to her attorney Joseph Rem.

She whimpered during the hearing with her head slumped to the side, and at one point was given a sugary drink to help her diabetes. Kelly Scrivener, prosecuting, said that Holding had stolen £90,000 between 2008 and 2011, forging documents to cover up the fraud, and had repaid just £24,000. She said £7,700 was paid out to Gala Coral online gambling and £6,700 to Ikea, while Holding had also claimed expenses for her voluntary role helping out at the pre-school. In June 2011, Holding went to Reverend Alison Shaw 'in hysterics' saying she had 'got things in a muddle', the court heard. Judge Paul Darlow said:” 'You plundered their accounts for your own benefit including gambling on internet sites.”' Victims: The congregation at St Boniface's church in Plymouth were betrayed by the fraud, a court heard . He also said that Holding, a divorced mother of two, had falsely claimed to be housebound when she was caught on camera outside her home. Jo Martin, defending, said: “'Since the allegations her fall from grace has been huge and her life has even more spiralled out of control. Undoubtedly she has a number of medical issues.” ' She said Holding would find prison life '‘extraordinarily difficult'’ because of her ailments. Ms Shaw, who took in Holding when her marriage broke down, read a statement to the court about the impact of the defendant's crimes. 'It was a huge sense of betrayal which has had a massive impact on the church and the church community,' the vicar said. 'She was central to everything in the church. Young people put her on a pedestal and she preached to the adults. “'She was a very moral person who told them how to behave. Nicola was trusted implicitly.”' Holding was wheeled out of court to begin her sentence at a prison which can cater for her medical condition.", "answer": ["Nicola Holding was a 'pillar of the community' for role at Plymouth church .\nBut she stole £90,000 and spent it on web gambling and Ikea furniture .\nClaimed she was too ill to go to court for sentencing for two years .\nHolding, 50, has now been sentenced to 30 months in jail for fraud ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "Former England captain Lewis Moody says he does not think England will win the World Cup this year. Moody, who won 71 caps over a 10-year career, believes Stuart Lancaster's team are 'not quite where they need to be' to lift the William Webb Ellis cup on October 31. The former Leicester and Bath flanker, speaking at an awards ceremony for the Prince's Trust in London, told the Press Association: 'I don't think England are in the right place at the moment to win the World Cup. Former England captain Lewis Moody does not think England are in a position to win the World Cup . Moody knows what it takes to win the tournament having lifted the Webb Ellis Cup in 2003 . 'If they can get through the pool stages they'll have a great, fighting chance. Being at home for every match makes a massive difference and if you get into a semi-final anything could happen - but I think at the minute they are probably not quite where they need to be to win the World Cup. 'They can certainly be there to push the others, and if they get into the semi-final then there is every chance they could make the final.' Moody, who cannot see beyond New Zealand as tournament winners, believes Lancaster may be hoping his squad will peak for 2019. He continued: 'He's been building a team, there are a lot of young new changes coming, so I think he'll be focusing on the next World Cup, especially as he's had that nice new contract extension.' However, he believes England can still win the Six Nations. Lancaster oversee training as his side prepare to face Scotland in the Six Nations on Saturday . How England and Scotland will line up for Saturday's Calcutta Cup clash at Twickenham . Moody said: 'It is disappointing that England have ended up in this position. They had a good chance to come away with a Grand Slam but they have got to focus on Scotland now. 'It should be a reasonably comfortable result against Scotland, and then go on and beat France. They can still win it, but it will be a big ask now - we are reliant on other teams.' Moody added: 'I am a huge fan of Stuart Lancaster. 'I think he's done terribly well and I think all that now Stuart is lacking is that win, that result that really says, 'Look, what I've been doing over the last four years has been about this, achieving this', and if we can take something out of the Six Nations, which will be tough now, then he'll have that.' One bonus is that the Six Nations may well have ironed out England's conundrum at fly-half and in the centres, Moody suggested, with George Ford and Jonathan Joseph cementing their places. He said: 'For me it is quite simple. I think Ford has stepped up and done a fantastic job. I'd keep him there, and he would be my man for the World Cup. It will be interesting to see where Owen (Farrell) slots in when he comes back. Moody thinks George Ford has stepped up as England centre and should keep his place for the World Cup . Ford offloads a pass during training as England prepare for Saturday's Six Nations match against Scotland . 'Joseph has stepped in and filled a void I think we've been nursing since Will Greenwood was playing, and that's some time ago now. 'And when Manu Tuilagi comes back I'd like to see Joseph and Tuilagi playing in the centres together and how they can work that. I think (Luther) Burrell has been all right but I think Joseph and Tuilagi are probably the future.' Moody was adamant Ford's rise had not consigned Farrell's days as England's starting number 10 to history. 'They are certainly not over,' he said. 'The fact George has come in and done so well, George Ford has had a fantastic start to his international career. 'Owen is a young man in his own right. Those two vied for the under 20s spots, they were centre and fly-half together when they played England under 20s together, so they know each other well. 'Owen is a great temperament and he'll work hard to make sure he is pushing George all the way for that 10 shirt.'", "answer": ["The 2015 Rugby World Cup starts in September and will be held in England .\nLewis Moody does not believe hosts are in a position to win tournament .\nFormer captain Moody does believe England can win the Six Nations .\nEngland play Scotland at Twickenham on Saturday for the Calcutta Cup .\nMoody backs England to secure a comfortable victory against the Scots ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "(CNN)Texas is nearly out of its lethal injection drug. If scheduled executions this Wednesday and the next go forward, the state will have completely exhausted its supply of pentobarbital. \"We're exploring all options,\" said Jason Clark, spokesman for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, \" including the continued use of pentobarbital or an alternate drug(s) in the lethal injection process.\" In recent years, states across the country have struggled to maintain a supply of lethal injection drugs as manufacturers either stopped producing the drugs or barred their use in executions. The European manufacturers of pentobarbital, an anesthetic, explicitly banned U.S. prisons from using its drug in executions. Tennessee has said it will electrocute inmates if it can't get the drugs it needs. Other states have sought out substitutes or gone with one drug instead of the traditional three-drug cocktail. In April, Oklahoma used midazolam as a substitute for pentobarbital as part of a three-drug cocktail in an execution that went awry. Clayton Lockett, a convicted rapist and murderer, writhed and convulsed after the drugs were administered. It took 43 minutes for him to die. Texas gets its pentobarbital from compounding pharmacies, which are not subject to Food and Drug Administration oversight, something opponents of the death penalty have decried.

{"question": "They say you don’t get much for your money these days – but a Scottish holiday home has just gone on the market for a pound. The one-bedroom flat in Rothesay on the Isle of Bute, valued at £20,000, is coming up for auction at the end of the month, making it almost certainly the cheapest flat in Britain. Seller Catherine Scott, 58, said: ‘It was my late husband’s property and we are looking for a quick sale. Scroll down for video . Location, location, location: This one-bed flat on the holiday island of Bute, Scotland, is coming up for auction for just £1, despite being valued at around £20,000 . Seller Catherine Scott, 58, said the flat belonged to her late husband and the family chose the low asking price because they are looking for 'a quick sale' ‘It has been in his family for a long time, but it is a lovely flat and would make someone a very nice little holiday home.’ The sandstone property is in Rothesay town centre, close to the 13th century castle and a five-minute walk from the harbour – although it does not offer sea views. Auction House Scotland will put the property under the hammer in Glasgow at 2pm on March 26. The company’s website describes the auction sale as ‘an excellent opportunity to purchase a Scottish holiday home or a buy-to-let investment for only £1’. Auction House Scotland says the property has a large lounge, kitchen, shower room and bedroom, with gas central heating and double-glazed windows . The town of Rothesay, where the property is located, is close to a 13th century castle and a five minute walk from the harbour which has ferries to Wemyss Bay . It adds: ‘The surrounding area presents ample local shops, a golf course, beautiful Scottish scenery and great access to ferry links to Wemyss Bay.’ The traditional second-floor flat has a large lounge, kitchen, shower room and bedroom, with gas central heating and double-glazed windows. Gillian Cochrane of Auction House Scotland said: ‘We’re expecting a big turnout, there’s been a lot of interest so far. It was our idea to put the guide price at £1. ‘The reason we did that is, firstly, you get a lot of interest; and secondly, the sellers just want a fast and final sale. Market experts believed the flat could be rented out for around £364 per month, or could provide a nice holiday home for whoever snaps it up . Auctioneers say the guide price of just £1 has attracted a lot of interest so far, and they are expecting the property to be snapped up quickly on March 26 . ‘When the hammer falls, it’s a done deal. Whereas if you are buying from an estate agent, it can drag on – about 30 per cent of estate agent deals fall through . ‘The flat can be a place you can go to for a short break, or you can rent it out.’ Market experts said the flat could be rented out at £364 per month.", "answer": ["One-bed flat in Rothesay, Isle of Bute, has been valued at around £20,000 .\nBut seller Catherine Scott, 58, is offering it for £1 in order to get 'quick sale'\nProperty is close to 13th century castle and a short walk from harbour ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "Paddy McNair admits he will fulfil his boyhood dream if he earns his first Northern Ireland cap against Scotland on Wednesday night. The Manchester United defender has been given his first taste of top-team action at Old Trafford by new boss Louis van Gaal this season. Now he is set to follow that up by making his international debut in Glasgow when Michael O'Neill's side take on the Scots at Hampden Park. Paddy McNair has made an impressive breakthrough for Manchester United this season at the back . The 19-year-old was forced to pull out of his first involvement with the national team last October due to injury, while he was an unused substitute a month later as the Irish lost 2-0 away to Romania. But he is expected to finally pull on the green jersey in the midweek friendly clash that will serve as a warm-up ahead of Sunday's crucial Euro 2016 qualifier with Finland at Windsor Park. 'It would be a dream come true if that happens,' said the teenage centre-half. 'As a young boy it is a dream to play for your country. 'I went to a few Northern Ireland games when I was very young but I don't remember too much about them. I can remember the atmosphere and hoping that one day I would be out there as well, so if I can do that on Wednesday I will be very proud.' The Northern Irishman competes with the Premier League's newest star Harry Kane at White Hart Lane . Wednesday's match will be just as important to the Scots as it is O'Neill's troops as both countries look to end their long absences from major tournaments by claiming a slot at next year's European Championships in France. While Northern Ireland are just a point off the summit of Group F after taking nine points from the first 12 available, Gordon Strachan's side are very much in the hunt themselves. They sit third in Group D, three points behind leaders Poland and level on seven with Germany and the Republic of Ireland. With that in mind, McNair does not expect an easy introduction to the international game. 'It's going to be tough,' he said. 'It's a game against another home nation and both teams want to win. It won't be a friendly. The 19-year-old has seen his game time limited in recent weeks but has done enough to earn a call-up . 'It's a game we can definitely win, though. We showed in the games in the qualifying group we can beat anybody. 'Scotland have some very good players. I've played against Steven Naismith earlier on this season and you can see why people rate him so highly.' McNair can also expect to come up against another familiar face clad in Dark Blue, with former United midfielder Darren Fletcher likely to line-up for the hosts. The 31-year-old - who quit the Red Devils in January after 12 years to sign for West Brom - played an influential dressing-room role while McNair was making his way through the Old Trafford ranks. Darren Fletcher (right) was influential in helping McNair settle into the United dressing room before he left . And the youngster happily admits he owes the four-time Premier League winner a huge debt of gratitude. 'Darren really helped me a lot and have to thank him a lot for that,' said McNair. 'When I first broke into the team he gave me a lot of advice and really did help me settle in. 'When you come through at Manchester United, it is such a big club with so much pressure on you. 'Darren was in the same position I'm in now at one stage so he would often come up to me before games and have a word to make sure my head was on right. 'Darren is a great player and I'm very happy to see him back playing regularly with West Brom.' Louis van Gaal took a risk on McNair when he had a shortage of defenders and was rewarded for his trust . In the 13 games McNair has racked for Van Gaal's side this term, he has done enough to leave the Dutchman so impressed that he reckons the Ballyclare youth could be a mainstay of the United line-up for the next decade. But McNair himself is trying not to look too far ahead. He said: 'I don't think I will really realise how good a season I have had until the end of the season when I look back at it, but so far I'm very happy. 'Am I surprised at how quickly things have gone this year? Yeah a little bit. 'Sometimes you just need a bit of luck to get your chance. But I was confident that once I got my chance I could take it.'", "answer": ["Paddy McNair could earn his first Northern Ireland cap against Scotland .\nThe Manchester United admits it will be a boyhood dream to play .\nThe 19-year-old broke into the Louis van Gaal's side earlier this season .\nClick here for all the latest Manchester United news ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "From treacherous road conditions to soggy jeans and frizzy hair - nobody enjoys cycling in the rain. But now there’s an ‘umbrella’ for bikes that’s designed to keep riders dry as they cycle along. The Leafxpro clip-on windshield, claims to enable cyclists to ride their bikes comfortably in the most miserable conditions, including rain, snow and gusty winds. Scroll down for video . The Leafxpro clip-on windshield (the basic version is illustrated), is designed to that cyclists can ride their bikes comfortably in the most miserable conditions, including rain, snow and gusty winds . Portuguese engineer and cycling enthusiast Manuel Brito, who came up with the idea, said the Leafxpro can withstand crosswinds of more than 50mph (80kph) because of its aerodynamic shape. ‘Leafxpro is aerodynamically designed to reduce air resistance and can be used in even the most demanding conditions,’ he said. The shield (pictured) is aerodynamically designed to reduce air resistance so it can be used in windy weather . ‘The resistance results showed that the kits can be used also in tougher conditions such as mountain biking as well.’ The plastic windshield will stop rain blowing into the face of a cyclist, and it shouldn’t steam up, like other more enclosed canopies. The device is designed to be fitted to any style of bike and can be packed away into a small bag when the weather improves, in just one minute. The kit weighs around 2.2lbs (1kg). It’s available to pre-order from Kickstarter in four models - Classic, Advanced, Storm and Family. Prices range from £99 ($152) for the basic model to £199 (£305) for the family kit which also protects a child on a rear bike seat. Mr Brito, 40, said: ‘The idea of Leafxpro arose because we love cycling and it’s disappointing to have to use polluting means of transport just because of the bad weather. ‘We started thinking that there had to be an efficient, versatile and comfortable solution that would provide a sense of freedom for all people who love cycling.’ It has taken him years to design and test the product, which is a modular structure that adapts to different weather conditions. The canopy is  available to pre-order from Kickstarter in four models - Classic, Advanced, Storm and Family (pictured) .Prices range from £99 ($152) for the basic model to £199 ($305) for the family kit which also protects a child on a rear bike seat . The device, which is designed to stop oncoming rain and keep a cyclist’s head and back dry, is designed to be fitted to any style of bike and can be packed away into a small bag when the weather improves. This image shows an illustration of the family version . ‘The Classic model, designed for episodes of snow, cold and light rain, turns easily into the Advanced or Storm models simply by sliding fasteners to join the modules,’ he explained. ‘LeafXPro kits are designed for the urban cyclist, for anyone who commutes to work by bicycle, for parents wanting to cycle their kids to school or people who want to enjoy bike tours as a tourist during sightseeing.’ ‘The Classic model, designed for episodes of snow, cold and light rain, turns easily into the Advanced or Storm models simply by sliding fasteners to join the modules,' Mr Brito said. The storm version covers a rider's head more as well as their arms . Last summer, a firm in Delft, the Netherlands, invented a simple clamp that fixes to a bike's handlebars to hold a windproof umbrella. The holder can also be used to store the umbrella when the rain stops too. The umbrella's asymmetric design is said to help it withstand high speed wind gusts of up to 70mph (113kph), because wind is directed over and around it. While its makers, Senz, cautions against riding in high winds, the umbrella design lends itself to coping with the air stream created by cycling. The clamp costs €39 (£31) while the umbrellas come in different sizes and are sold separately for €25 (£20) and €50 (£40).", "answer": ["Leafxpro clip-on windshield comes in four designs to keep cyclists dry .\nWas designed by a Portuguese engineer and cycling enthusiast .\nIt' claims to withstand crosswinds of more than 50mph (80kph)\nCollapsible windshield is available to pre-order from Kickstarter from £99 ."], "label": "SUM"}

At first the adorable seal tries his best to jump on both the kayaks, but he keeps sliding off, back into the water. Hitching a ride: Ron the friendly seal attempts to climb onto a kayak in Poole Bay, Dorset . Attempt one: The young pup makes it onto one of the kayaks, and momentarily keeps his balance . He then manages to get onto the left kayak, but just as it looks like he has found himself a comfortable spot - he falls in again. The pup, known locally as Ron the Seal,  finally succeeds by draping himself across both of the kayaks. Kayaker Andrew Linstead shot the video of the young seal's repeated attempts to climb aboard his raft as he paddled in Poole Bay. This is the third time Mr Linstead has had an encounter with Ron the Seal in four months. Last November, while Mr Linstead was practicing rolling his kayak in the water, he noticed the seal watching him and then joining in, rolling every time he did. Fail: Unfortunately for Ron the Seal, he cannot manage to stay on the kayak, and falls back in the water . On it again: Ron the seal proves he is not a quitter and is soon at it again, trying to climb the kayaks . A month later, the pair met again, as Ron jumped on the back of his kayak and hitched a ride around for several hours. The latest encounter, filmed by Mr Linstead, lasted for four hours with Ron climbing on and off Mr Linstead's kayak and even bringing him a fish it had caught. Mr Linstead, from London, said: 'I've had quite a few encounters with Ron now, we are becoming good friends! 'The first time I saw him was when I was practising rolling my kayak. Ron seemed to roll whenever I rolled my kayak. 'Afterwards I put a message on a Facebook local community page asking if anyone knew anything about the seal and I got lots of responses. The locals have called it Ron, as in Ronseal. 'I think when Ron now sees me he feels comfortable. 'This time I was out on my own and I saw another kayaker. I asked him if he could brace or roll his kayak in case Ron got on his boat and tipped up over. Resting spot: Kayaker Andrew Linstead shot the video of the young seal's repeated attempts to climb aboard his raft as he paddled in Poole Bay . New buddies: Their encounter lasted for four hours with Ron climbing on and off Mr Linstead's kayak and even bringing him a fish it had caught . Another ride: This is the third time Ron and Mr Linstead, from London, has met in four months . 'He said he couldn't so he came alongside me and held on to my kayak. 'I don't think he believed me that Ron would come over but he did. 'Ron tried to climb on but he kept slipping off. It went on for hours, I took my last shot of him about four hours later. 'I've spoken to other kayakers in the area and they say they have never seen anything like that.' Julie Hatcher, from Dorset Wildlife Trust, said: 'This is a young grey seal. Seals tend to be a bit wary of people, we don't know why this one isn't. It might just be a personality thing. 'They are solitary animals when they are at sea. They come together for breeding but generally are solitary in the water. 'Young ones tend to be more friendly and playful. I have dived with seals and the young ones will come near you, they can be quite curious and like playing hide and seek, but the adults don't tend to.' The waters of the UK are home to more than 180,000 grey seals, which is more than a third of the world's population.", "answer": ["Young grey seal filmed as he attempts to hitch a ride with two kayaks .\nVideo was shot by kayaker Andrew Linstead in Poole Bay, Dorset .\nThe seal, nicknamed Ron, made several attempts, and kept falling in ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "Doctors  stress the importance of detecting disease early on to give people the best chance of recovery. And in the very near future you could get these early warning signs using just your smartphone. A San Francisco firm has developed a sensor that identifies gases and molecules released in a person’s breath that could hint at an underlying illness. Doctor in a stick? The very early model of the sensor (pictured) has been created by San Francisco-based BoydSense and is on display at this year’s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona . Advanced software and prediction algorithms are then used with a connected app to reveal any anomalies. The very early model of the sensor has been created by San Francisco-based BoydSense and is on display at this year’s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. Endogenous volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are released either through everyday metabolic activity, or by diseases in the body. Once created, they travel into the blood and are released in urine or breath. In addition to detecting volatile compounds in the breath, the firm said the sensor could be used to identify compounds released by rotting food . Some compounds, including carbon for instance, are released naturally. BoydSense has therefore developed software that can identify at which point the level of a gas or compound is beyond what is considered normal. It uses predictive algorithms to then convert the data so that patients and doctors can understand what the results mean. It is hoped that complex processing will prevent needless worry or give a false reading that suggests they are ill. If the sensor is added to a smartphone, for example, a patient could record their breath and the results could be sent to their doctor automatically. In particular, the sensors build on current breath gas analysers that are used to detect early signs of diabetes and even lung cancer. In addition to detecting volatile compounds in the breath, Mr Thuillier said the sensor could be used to identify compounds released by rotting food. In the MailOnline demo, the BoydSense sensor was able to detect an orange within 30 seconds . BoydSense’s boss Bruno Thuillier gave MailOnline a demo of the technology at Mobile World Congress. The current sensor is a prototype and syncs with a smartphone via Bluetooth - although Mr Thuillier hopes future models will be embedded into the phones themselves. It takes around a minute to normalise and stabilise, a process needed to ensure that any readings are not contaminated by previous ‘sniffs’. This process is expected to be much faster on a finalised version, however. For the demo, the sensor is then placed inside a jar containing molecules released by oranges. Within about 30 seconds the sensor beeped to say it had recognised the molecules and a picture of an orange appeared on the connected smartphone. This was a simplified way of demonstrating its capabilities, but Mr Thuillier explained that the compounds released by oranges and vanilla - another jar in the demo - were complex enough to show its potential. If attached to a smartphone, the sensor could be placed in a fridge or cupboard and detect if chicken is nearing its best-before date, or if fruit and vegetables are about to turn. Mr Thuillier said: ‘I am excited to help lead in the creation of the first multi-bio sensing platform that detects and analyses biosignatures anywhere, anytime. This platform will improve the way consumers manage their wellness. BoydSense aims to be the world leader in solutions and services that enable and transform the way people gather and manage their biosignature analytics.’", "answer": ["The technology has been developed by BoydSense .\nIt recognises and analyses gases for so-called biosignatures .\nGases on the breath, for example, can be early indicators of disease .\nSensor could also reveal if food in your fridge is near its sell-by date .\nInventor hopes to add the technology to future smartphonesAnd he said sensors could be ready by the end of this year ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "For most boys, China would seem the ideal place to go to school. Just days after football was officially added to the national curriculum in a bid to win the World Cup, the country's air force has announced plans for Top Gun-style training for pupils as young as 14 to develop tomorrow's fighter pilots. A total of 16 senior high schools have been enlisted as 'Air Force Teenager Aviation Schools', according to the People's Daily Online. Sky-high dreams: A team of 77 pilots aged 18 and over recently took to the skies for the first time in a five-hour flight training demonstration at one of the air force's existing junior flying schools . Aspiring face: These teenage pilots have been trained by elite from Chinese Air Force while maintaining academic studies - as the new younger recruits will be . Off you fly: Each student conducted two flights, logging around 80 minutes of time in the air . The news came as China's air force released pictures of its current intake of 18-year-old trainee pilots being taught at its junior flying school. The new 'Top Gun' schools that will give training to boys aged 14 and up will be located in 15 cities across China, including regional capitals like Wuhan and Changsha, and will be chosen based on their previous performance and the level of support they are able to get from local government. The judging body is formed by representatives from the Ministry of Education of China, the General Political Department and Air Force. All schools are regular senior high schools that offer mainstream academic courses. Cream of the crop: The students were selected from senior high schools around the country . Learn to fly: The students have to complete 18 hours' training in basic aviation theory as well as 28 hours of pre-flight study and one hour in a flight simulator . Lead the world: Officials from the Air Force said China had decided to step up its game because major powers in the world all invest heavily in training pilots from young ages . We want you: The poster of China's Teenage Aviation School programme . Special 'Aviation Experimental Classes' will be set up in these Teenage Aviation Schools, which plan to recruit 1,000 students every year. A class is usually made up by 30 to 50 students in China. This means there will be approximately 20 to 30 teen pilots classes every year. These classes are jointly managed by the schools and Air Force recruiting authorities. Male teenagers between 14 and 16 years old from all over China can apply before September 1, the start of an academic year in China. Once accepted, successful candidates will be given meal and living allowances, a rare exception for students in China. Scholarships will also be offered to the cream of the crop. These teen pilots will be taught under the programme for three years before entering the University Entrance Examination in China for a chance to further their studies in aviation universities in the country. While news about Teenager Aviation School has just been released, People's Daily Online published a gallery of a team of trained Chinese teen pilots taking to the skies. These 77 students, who are aged around 18, were selected from senior high schools around the country to receive Air Force training at junior flying schools. Start them young: The country is endeavouring to provide pilot training among young male pupils in senior high schools . Large-scale recruitment: Besides specialised air force schools, regular senior high schools are to set up experimental classes to train young pilots . In their first public flying demonstration recently, these teen pilots carried out five hours of real-equipment flight training. The training took place at a air base in Changchun, provincial capital of Jilin in northeast China. Shi Yansong, one of the teen pilots, said though their training followed a quasi military standard, he felt he still had much to learn from their commanders who were Air Force elite. Unprecedented showcase: This was the first time China had arranged real flight training for teen pilots . Ready for take-off: Shi Yansong, one of the teen pilots in the flying training, said it was his dream to become a pilot in the future . Air base: The training took place in Changchun in northeast China . 'Flying a jet feels so amazing,' said Shi, 'I must become a real pilot in the future.' As China's first batch of training pilots who maintain regular academic studies, the teenagers' flying debut is a landmark on the history of China's teenage aviation education, commented People's Daily Online. Peng Junxia, head of China's Air Force recruiting bureau, told Chinese media that the junior flying schools were established because major powers in the world all invest heavily in training pilots from young ages. In addition, China hopes such schools can raise a large number of outstanding Air Force commanders in the years to come. Big occasion: Students and trainers take part in the ribbon-cutting ceremony at the military training demonstration . Military vs academic: Unlike regular air force members who often give up academic study for military training, these teen pilots are taught by top faculty in China .", "answer": ["16 senior high schools across China have been selected to give training .\n'Aviation Experimental Classes' will be set up for cultivating young pilots .\nClasses are set to recruit 1,000 boys between 14 and 16 years old annually .\nPupils have the chance to enter air force universities upon graduation .\nTrainee fighter pilots at air force's existing junior flying school recently took to the skies for public demonstration of training regime ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "(CNN)Sen. Rand Paul, who is expected to announce on April 7 that he will be running for the presidency, is garnering a great deal of attention as he travels around the country promoting his brand of libertarian conservatism. The Kentucky senator's widely publicized appearance this month at the South by Southwest festival at Austin, Texas, was one opportunity he used to appeal to a tech-savvy audience. His particular blend of ideas -- a combination of libertarianism and Republican conservatism -- stands out from the rest of the pack. Younger Republicans, the much-desired millennial vote, seem attracted by what they are hearing. What accounts for his appeal? In an era when so many Americans seem frustrated with shallow, personality-based politics, there seems to be genuine interest in a candidate who is fighting for a set of ideas. For many disaffected younger Republicans, Paul offers a version of the conservative agenda that seems foreign to the modern GOP. For almost half a century, \"big government conservatism\" has ruled the party. Although conservatism is theoretically about limited government, the historical reality has been much different. On national defense, the hawks of the GOP have been victorious. Even while railing against the dangers of a big federal government, Republicans have lined up to support higher defense spending and a massive military-industrial complex. Though the GOP has little tolerance for many social safety net programs, the party has accepted sizable government support to industry, such as the financial bailout known as TARP in 2008 and subsidies for certain economic interests. Paul has been a vocal critic of the neoconservative turn that the GOP has embraced in recent decades, during which the party moved beyond support for high national security spending and toward a bolder vision of aggressive nation-building and regime change. For some Republicans, including Paul, these policies were at the heart of the failures of George W. Bush's presidency and a sharp departure from the party's principles. Similarly, Paul has been one of the few Republican voices to argue that post 9/11 surveillance policies have dangerously curtailed civil liberties. At the local level, he has criticized the militarization of police forces and the treatment of African Americans by law enforcement officers. Paul has also backed away from some tenets of social conservatism that don't sit well with a growing number of Republican voters. He has been an outspoken advocate of giving states the right to legalize marijuana. He has been attuned to the ways in which younger generations of Republicans are not on board with the evangelical fervor of the 1970s conservative movement and want to move in a different direction. While many Republicans have talked about the need for their party to tackle issues involving race and inequality in ways that are different from Democrats, most have been unwilling to offer any substantive ideas. Indeed, the recent budget blueprint from congressional Republicans exposed how thin discussions of a Republican anti-poverty program are. Their budget centers around cuts to key social safety net programs such as Medicare and regressive supply side tax cuts. But Paul, who has appeared to be supportive of a stringent budget, has also been willing to put forward bolder ideas, including criminal justice reform, that deal directly with the conditions that have devastated African American communities. Can Paul really win? That is unclear. Republican strategist Matthew Dowd told The New York Times: \"It's one thing to be interesting; it's another thing to be compelling. They've got to see him sitting in the Oval Office. And I do not think Rand has crossed that threshold yet.\" There are many skeptics who don't think that he has what it takes and that he has a controversial record. Paul's extremely critical remarks about key aspects of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 will certainly come back to bite him, as will some of his blistering attacks on the Federal Reserve. Paul is also trying to make the case for a libertarian conservatism that is not pure. Paul is still a Republican, so he will continue to fit his ideas within the broader agenda of the GOP. He is also a politician at heart and will make compromises that he believes are essential to survive. While Paul argues that he is trying to take some of the ideas that libertarians liked about his father and make them politically viable, some of his supporters smell a sellout. Arguably, we have seen this recently when he signed the controversial letter to Iran led by Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas (a neoconservative mentored by the hawkish Bill Kristol), switched his approach to the issue of same-sex marriage and gave support to an aggressive war against ISIS. \"This is more than a flip-flop. This is a backflip,\" the editor of an anti-war website told the Daily Beast. \"This was the last straw. I've put up with a lot from that guy! I've had to defend him like a Jesuit. I'm done. Let somebody else do it.\" But if Rand Paul can sell primary voters that his blend of ideas still offers something distinct from the rest of the Republican candidates, at a minimum he can help reshape the debate within the GOP by raising questions about some of the party's core positions.", "answer": ["Julian Zelizer: Rand Paul, due to announce for presidency, has attracted a lot of attention .\nHe says the Kentucky senator can appeal to younger Republicans with a libertarian brand of conservatism ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "Dili, East Timor (CNN)Stacey Addison, who says she was detained for months in East Timor because she unwittingly shared a taxi with a stranger carrying methamphetamine, is headed home. Addison boarded a plane Tuesday on the first leg of her journey back to Oregon. \"I am thrilled to report that Dr. Stacey Addison has gotten her passport back, and is now on a plane returning home here to Oregon,\" Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Oregon) said. \"This is terrific news for Stacey, for her family, and for all the Oregonians who have followed Stacey's story and helped support her from afar,\" Merkley said in a statement. Addison, 41, was detained in September in the small Southeast Asian nation in a drug case in which she says she's innocent. She was released in December but she still couldn't leave because her passport -- seized during the investigation -- had not been returned. Former East Timorese President and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jose Ramos-Horta, hosted her temporarily at his home. Addison's arrest in September was an unexpected bump in what had been a multi-year trip around the world. She said she had been traveling solo since January 2013, having quit her job as a veterinarian to explore the globe. On September 5, she was sharing a cab from near the Indonesian border to the East Timor capital of Dili. On the way, a fellow passenger asked to stop to pick up a package at a DHL office, her mother, Bernadette Kero of Oregon, has told CNN. After the man picked up the package, police surrounded the car and arrested the occupants, according to Kero. The package was found to contain methamphetamine, Addison has said. She initially was held for four nights, and a judge released her -- but prevented her from leaving the country while the case was still being investigated -- after the man testified that he didn't know her, Kero said. In late October, during a court appearance where she thought she'd retrieve her passport, a judge ordered her arrest again and sent her to Gleno prison outside Dili. Paul Remedios, a lawyer representing Addison, said at the time that the court detained her again because there was a warrant for her arrest, and that the reason for the warrant was unclear. Kero told CNN in November that the case was a \"nightmare.\" Journalist Wayne Lovell in Dili and CNN's Greg Morrison from Atlanta.

Swann watched on as England slumped to another heavy World Cup loss, with Sri Lanka chasing down their 309 for six with ease, winning with nine wickets and 16 balls to spare. The defeat goes alongside reverses against Australia and New Zealand, with Scotland the only team England have beaten so far. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Cricket World Cup Highlights: England vs Sri Lanka . Former England spinner Graeme Swann (pictured in 2013) has hit out at the England and Wales Cricket Board . Wins over Afghanistan and Bangladesh would take them to the quarter-finals, but Swann thinks the problems are evident. Writing on Twitter, he said: 'A positive thing that can come of this world cup is that maybe the top brass will realise just how out of date our approach is.' Swann also aired his views on BBC Radio 5 Live, adding that England had been overly pleased to get what he considered to be an average score. 'I think the problem lies not just with the bowling but the whole approach. It was a very self-congratulatory 310, everyone was saying 'brilliant'. These days that's about average and not a great score,' he said. 'We should be looking for 340, 350; The difference between the top teams and everyone else is immense. They're saying the is the limit when you bat, we're still looking at par scores.' Swann feels the answer could lie with former Nottinghamshire team-mate Alex Hales. 'There's a bit of stubbornness about the selection policy,' he added. 'I like Gary Ballance, he's a great lad, but I think even he'd admit that he shouldn't be in the team at the minute, he's in horrible form.

He said: 'There was a delay of several seconds between seeing the eruption and the arrival of the shockwave and sound. 'This was very exciting as I didn't know how strong the shockwave would be. 'But when it happened I felt the breath of wind from the interior of the earth like an extremely brief squall. In 1914, the then-dormant volcano emitted the largest eruption in Japan during the twentieth century . Szeglat was able to capture the volcanic lightning, as well as an explosive shockwave which rippled through the sky . 'After that, my friend and I laughed loudly and we were very happy. 'The lightning is very rare and does not appear in a normal ash cloud but in clouds from pyroclastic flows - which are mixtures of rock fragments and hot gases. 'Pyroclastic flows are the most dangerous hazards on volcanoes and so I was a little bit afraid when a big one was happening in front of me - but in fact the whole experience was a great adventure.'", "answer": ["Marc Szeglat, 47, shot the footage at the highly active Sakurajima volcano on the Japanese island of Kyushu .\nSakurajima has been erupting on a regular basis since 1955 and is a constant danger to city of Kagoshima .\nIn 1914, the then-dormant volcano emitted the largest eruption in Japan during the twentieth century ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "Former head of Knox Grammar Ian Paterson has denied touching a young woman's bottom during a school musical to the cheering of young boys, as he admitted deliberately hindering a 1996 investigation into child sex abuse. In the second shocking day of evidence at the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sex Abuse, Dr Paterson said he did 'absolutely not' touch Lucy Perry, who was 15-years-old, during a rehearsal of 'Guys and Dolls' in 1989. 'They were roaring their approval for her performance as the sultry dancer,' Dr Paterson told the inquiry, under intense questioning from counsel assisting the commission David Lloyd. Dr Ian Paterson, the former headmaster of Knox Grammar, has provided evidence to the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sex Abuse for two days . Lucy Perry, the CEO of an international women's charity, told the commission on Monday that Dr Paterson had touched her behind during a rehearsal of Guys and Dolls. She said the action was greeted by a 'roar of approval' from young men in the crowd . Lucy Perry was surprised by the reaction her testimony triggered from victims attending the inquiry, with many standing up to applaud her as she left . In explosive testimony on Wednesday, Dr Paterson also accepted he had hindered a police investigation of claims into child sex abuse led by Inspector Elizabeth Cullen in 1996. Ian Paterson said on Wednesday that when a police inspector from the child protection unit approached him in 1996 about six teachers at Knox about whom there had been complaints, he did not give her full information. In reply to David Lloyd counsel advising the royal commission, which is inquiring into Knox's handling of sex abuse complaints, Dr Paterson agreed he knew this would impede the investigation. Ms Perry, 41, now the CEO of an international women's charity, told the commission on Monday that Dr Paterson, the show's producer, had singled her out during the joint rehearsal between Knox and Roseville College. As she walked to the edge of the stage 'he placed his hand on my backside'. 'I would describe it as between a pat and a grope,' Ms Perry told the commission. 'He then slid his hand right down to cup my buttocks and (I) felt him touch my genitals outside of my clothing.' Ms Perry continued: 'I was humiliated in front of the boys and I heard the boys cheering. 'I was disgusted with Paterson's behaviour and thought he was demonstrating to the Knox boys that it was perfectly acceptable, even admirable, to be disrespectful to girls.' Ms Perry was not interested in pressing charges against Dr Paterson but changed her mind in 2009. 'I wanted to let police know that I was happy to provide a statement if it was going to be useful to demonstrate the culture of disrespect engendered by the school and to highlight the environment and attitudes fostered by the headmaster,' she said. Knox Grammar former headmaster Ian Paterson said on Tuesday that he is 'deeply and profoundly sorry' for failing to recognise and respond to child sex abuse perpetrated while he was head of the school . Dr Paterson also said it never occurred to him to contact police after a balaclava-clad 'intruder' broke into a boarding house and sexually assaulted a Year 8 student . An arrest warrant has been issued for former Knox teacher Christopher Fotis after he failed to appear at a royal commission hearing last Tuesday . His testimony followed a day of evidence on Tuesday where it emerged Dr Paterson allowed teachers he knew had abused children to stay on staff for years. Others he suspected of sexually abusing students were allowed to resign and Dr Paterson wrote them positive letters of recommendation following their departures. The hearing on Tuesday also heard that the student files of abuse victims went missing from the school, and no detailed records of sex abuse allegations relating to teachers and students were recorded in their files. Dr Paterson said Knox conducted a number of internal investigations into abuse suffered by students without reporting the cases the authorities, but repeatedly denied that incidences were kept from police or DOCs to protect the school's reputation. He said he made the decision not to sack one teacher who watched hardcore pornography with students in 1987 because the man had 'made a very silly mistake' and had 'enormous potential in the profession'. In a case involving another teacher in 1987, Dr Paterson said he sent a 15-year-old student to the library to 'think about what he said' after the teen confided in him about being abused - describing the student as a 'dramatical boy' who 'liked to exaggerate stories'. Dr Paterson also said it never occurred to him to contact police after a balaclava-clad 'intruder' broke into a boarding house and sexually assaulted a Year 8 student in 1988. He added that he did not think to report the matter to police even after he formed a suspicion the attack was perpetrated by a staff member. On Tuesday, Dr Paterson was questioned about former teacher Craig Treloar who worked at the school until 2009 despite Dr Paterson being aware of the pornography incident that occurred in 1987. Treloar was convicted of child sex abuse in 2010 and sentenced to jail for two years. Dr Paterson said former Knox general duties master Stuart Pearson called him late in 1987 and told him Treloar had shown pornography to a young student. He said he had not asked any further details, including how many boys were shown the tape, how often it had occurred or if he'd propositioned any boys. The hearing continues through Wednesday. Purple ribbons were tied out the front of Knox Grammar School in honour of victims of paedophile teachers . Dr Paterson read out a statement apologising for his failings at the beginning of the commission's hearing in Sydney today .

{"question": "Businesses attacked Labour last night over plans to force companies to share profits with employees. Senior party figures are said to be considering a proposal to oblige all firms with more than 50 staff to set up a profit-sharing scheme. Workers would then be handed a regular cash sum based on their employers' financial position. Senior business leaders have lined up to predict that Ed Miliband is a potential 'catastrophe' for the country . Labour last night said the idea was not official policy, although a shadow minister said it was being considered at the top of the party. But senior business leaders warned the plan would encourage employers not to take on staff. It is the latest in a string of damaging clashes between Labour and business leaders – who have lined up to predict that Ed Miliband is a potential 'catastrophe' for the country. Glen Cooper, chief executive of Midlands bollard makers ATG Access, said: 'We need Britain's small companies to grow bigger, not be stifled by Labour's meddling. 'This idea will make companies stop taking on employees rather than grow. I am happy to run my own scheme to motivate my employees, but I don't want to be dictated to by Labour.' The Labour policy would mirror the situation in economically feeble France, where companies with more than 50 employees have extra obligations, such as the establishment of a workers' council. It has been reported that such burdens are costing 140,000 jobs, and President Francois Hollande wants to repeal them. Charlie Bradshaw, managing director of Matrix APA, a product design company with 60 staff, said: 'Forcing companies to share profits when they hit 50 employees, just as France seeks to repeal similar laws, will threaten jobs' Simon Walker, of the Institute Of Directors, said: 'We cannot believe that the Labour leader will take such an obviously counterproductive measure seriously. 'Employee profit sharing can work well for companies who choose it, but it has to be up to them. This idea would give companies with 49 employees a very strong incentive not to grow. 'The French government is actually attempting to reduce the bureaucracy that kicks in at 50 workers because they know it is damaging job creation.' Mr Thomas, chairman of the Co-op party, said the policy was being considered at the highest levels . Charlie Bradshaw, managing director of Matrix APA, a product design company with 60 staff, said: 'Forcing companies to share profits when they hit 50 employees, just as France seeks to repeal similar laws, will threaten jobs. 'Small companies should be run by the people who know their culture and staff best, not by central government.' There are around 36,000 companies with 50 or more employees in Britain, employing a total of 12.9million. It means the suggested legislation would therefore affect about 53 per cent of those employed in the UK. It is being championed by Gareth Thomas, a shadow minister and has been adopted by the affiliated Co-operative Party, represented in Parliament by 31 Labour MPs – including Ed Balls. Mr Thomas, chairman of the Co-op party, said the policy was being considered at the highest levels. He added: 'Hard work too often doesn't lead to higher wages for the working majority, but simply gets funnelled into greater rewards for those at the very top.' A Labour source insisted last night the idea was not party policy. Tory MP Julian Smith said: 'This is another policy that will kill off jobs. Every Labour government in history has left unemployment higher.' Mr Miliband has proposed a series of ideas which have infuriated business groups – including an energy price freeze and plans for more paternity leave.

The British team showed their strength on the final climb of the Croix de Chaubouret and the pair punched the air after both making valuable moves towards the yellow jersey. The pack had already thinned out considerably when Welshman Thomas made his big move with three kilometres to go of the longest stage of the race.

{"question": "A man who survived a suicide leap from the Golden Gate Bridge has told in detail how he was saved by a sea lion which kept him afloat until the coastguard arrived. Kevin Hines is now a global speaker on mental health issues and shared his remarkable story at a suicide prevention conference in New South Wales, Australia. Aged just 21, he was suffering from bipolar disorder and psychosis when he jumped from the San Francisco landmark on a chilly September day in 2000. Scroll down for video . Emotional: Mental health campaigner Kevin Hines told a conference yesterday how he survived a suicide attempt nearly 15 years ago - because a sea lion circled under him and kept him afloat until help arrived . Although he lived, Mr Hines almost lost his ability to walk and was saved only by 14 hours of surgery on his back. But immediately after the four-second fall there was another, more incredible miracle. He told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation: 'I guess you would call it a mammal began swimming beneath me and I'm thinking, \"Oh man, a shark is about to devour me\". 'I was on a show for suicide prevention and I mentioned that I thought there was this shark on this show and a man wrote into the show and he said, \"Kevin, I'm so very glad you're alive, I was less than two feet away from you when you jumped\". 'He said: \"It haunted me until this day; it was no shark, it was a sea lion and the people above looking down believed it to be keeping you afloat until the coast guard brought a ride behind you.\"' Landmark: By a stroke of luck, a witness saw Mr Hines jump from the vast bridge and alerted the coastguard . Conference: Mr Hines spoke at the New South Wales Police Force Mental Health Intervention Team conference in Sydney, Australia. The force attended nearly 50,000 mental health incidents last year . With temperatures in the bay's waters as low as 12C, Mr Hines could have died of hypothermia had a witness not seen him jump and raised the alarm. Mr Hines said he never intended to tell his story because he was 'embarrassed', but changed his mind after a life-affirming talk to 120 students, many of whom had suicidal thoughts. Now he has written a book about his experience, Cracked, Not Broken, and appears at conferences all over the world. With medication and professional help he has managed to reduce his symptoms, including the voices in his head which told him to jump on that day 14 and a half years ago. 'The message is very very simple,' he told ABC. 'You don't have to die this way.' Mr Hines says he is one of just 34 survivors of falls from the Golden Gate Bridge, which rises high above the San Francisco Bay, and the only one to become a mental health campaigner. Population: Sea lions basking on piers in San Francisco. Mr Hines said the theory was perfectly plausible . He spoke yesterday as part of the NSW Police Force Mental Health Intervention Team conference in Sydney. The force attended almost 50,000 mental health incidents in 2014 alone, and set up to conference to discuss how the often-misunderstood issue should be tackled. Mr Hines had talked about being saved by a sea lion before, including in a 2013 blog post. 'There are a large number of reporters and speculators who have claimed it was really a seal, and even those who have claimed that there was nothing but me in that water,' he wrote.

{"question": "Grayson Perry's unusual Gingerbread House holiday home has been branded an 'abomination' by local villagers inundated with art fans flocking to see the property. The Turner Prize-winning artist teamed up with the organisation Living Architecture to design the unique holiday cottage in the sleepy village of Wrabness. But locals - who battled the original plans - claim art fans flocking to catch a glimpse of the artist's creation are clogging up the narrow streets. Scroll down for video . The finished work - which can be seen from miles around - includes ceramic tiles featuring safety pins, old-style tapes, hearts and the word 'Julie' The quirky cottage was supposed to 'explore the special character and unique qualities of Essex' and is expected to open for holiday bookings in the spring. But the local council has already been forced to redesign surrounding roads and car parks to accommodate the influx of art fans. One frustrated villager, who refused to be named, said: 'This is a tiny village known for its tranquillity.

{"question": "Of all the players Manchester City might have expected to drive the final nail into their Champions League coffin Ivan Rakitic was a long way down the list, but it was the former Sevilla midfielder who got the goal on Wednesday night. Here MailSport takes a closer look at the Croatian midfielder more than proving his worth in his first season at the Nou Camp. Ivan Rakitic superbly lifts the ball over the on-rushing Joe Hart to give Barcelona the lead against Man City . Rakitic loops the ball over Hart and past Vincent Kompany to earn Barcelona a 1-0 lead at the Nou Camp . When he signed in the summer what was the reaction? There was no hysteria but it was considered a welcome addition for two reasons – firstly they need midfielders after selling Cesc Fabregas to Chelsea and Thiago to Bayern Munich, and second Rakitic was, along with his fellow countryman Luka Modric, the best midfielder in La Liga last season. Is he an improvement on the aforementioned Fabregas and Thiago? Thiago has the potential to be the best of the three but appalling luck with injuries has stalled his career. Is Rakitic better than Cesc? Probably not but he has many of the same characteristics so that has made him a worthy replacement. The Croatia international challenges for the ball with Manchester City midfielder James Milner . Rakitic was brought to Barcelona from Sevilla for £14million to replace Cesc Fabregas, who joined Chelsea . And those characteristics are? He is versatile in as much as he can play behind the striker and score goals as he did regularly for his former club Sevilla and he can play deep in front of the centre-back as he also did, although less so for his former team, and as he did for Barça last Saturday away at Eibar. Much like his compatriot at Real Madrid Modric, he can tackle, pass, and shoot. He’s a very complete midfielder. Who brought him to Spain? Sevilla signed him from Schalke for €2.5m. It was another work of genius from the club’s Sporting Director Monchi because within a very short space of time it was clear Rakitic was destined for bigger things and would make the club a tidy profit. Rakitic (laying down on left of trophy) captained Sevilla to Europa League glory in 2014 . Rakitic was born in Switzerland but plays international football for Croatia . Did he consider England? His wife, Raquel Mauri, is a hairdresser from Sevilla, and so he preferred to stay in Spain. When Barcelona came calling it was a no-brainer. He was close to going to Chelsea as a 16-year-old but his father advised him to move to Schalke instead. The language was not going to be a problem wherever he went because the Swiss born Croatian international speaks five languages. And his battle with Modric will be one to look out for on Sunday? It will. And even more so because Rakitic was denied the chance to face his international team-mate in the first Clasico of the season because he was left out of the starting eleven. Rakitic is mobbed by his Barcelona team-mates after opening the scoring against City on Wednesday . Midfielder Rakitic is joined in celebration by Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar Jnr . How did that work out for Luis Enrique? Badly. Many had tipped the coach to resist the temptation of giving Luis Suarez his debut after so long out, move Iniesta forward to the front three and bring in Xavi alongside Rakitic. Instead Luis Enrique dropped Rakitic despite the fact that he had been playing well and lined Xavi up alongside Andres Iniesta. ‘They are great players but they are not getting any younger,’ Paul Clement told me after the game. Barca started well but lost control of midfielder and ultimately the match. Without Rakitic they were completely out-run in the middle of the park. When he is at his best, he is their engine.

{"question": "Jailed: Ali Adorus is currently in jail in Ethiopia after being convicted of terrorism offences . This is the Londoner who travelled on 'safari' with evil Islamic State killer Jihadi John. Ali Adorus, 33, travelled to Tanzania in 2009 with Mohammed Emwazi when the pair were held and questioned by security services before being deported. Adorus, who was born in Ethiopia but grew up in London, is currently in an African prison after being convicted of terrorism offences. The married father-of-one was arrested in Ethiopia in January last year. Authorities say he entered the country in 2011 to try to establish Islamic rule through acts of 'terrorism'. Adorus grew up in a council house in north London and it remains unclear how he befriended Emwazi. He is believed to have worked as a security guard after studying at college in east London. Adorus was also known to the British intelligence services and received support from the controversial human rights group Cage, according to The Times. Along with German national Marcel Schrodl, the three were questioned by security services in Tanzania and later by British intelligence officers in Amsterdam and Dover. They complained about their treatment to Cage, who provoked outrage last week after describing Emwazi as ‘extremely kind’ and ‘beautiful young man’. At his trial in Ethiopia, prosecutors said that Adorus was 'accused of trying to unconstitutionally change the government and introduce Islamic government in Ethiopia by terrorism'. But Cage said that he was simply visiting relatives and gave a false confession in Amharic - a language he does not speak - after being 'brutally tortured'. They said that the case 'confirms a worrying pattern of young Britons of East African descent being harassed by MI5 and later ending up tortured in a third country'. He initially faced the death penalty but was then jailed for four-and-a-half years, along with two other British nationals. An anonymous family friend said that Adorus's relatives would not discuss his case in Ethiopia. Friend: Adorus travelled to Tanzania with Mohammed Emwazi, revealed last week as the man behind the 'Jihadi John' mask . Neighbours on the estate where he grew up described him as a 'good lad' and said that they found it difficult to believe that he had been jailed. One of his neighbours in London described him as a 'kind, beautiful and innocent human being'. In August, his wife wrote on a support group: 'We will get him home soon, Inshallah!' Following his arrest and detention in Ethiopia, Cage went on to petition the former foreign secretary William Hague and the Ethiopian ambassador over concerns that Adorus had not received a fair trial. In a letter on the Change petition site, they said: 'I have seen information according to which he was severely tortured in Maekelawi police station. 'According to an urgent appeal made to the United Nations, Ali Adorus was brutally beaten, handcuffed behind his back for an extended period of time, beaten on his hands with heavy wires, hooded, given electric shocks and denied access to a toilet.' Jihadi John: Mohammed Emwazi was expelled from Tanzania in 2009 for being drunk and disorderly on a flight from Amsterdam along with Adorus . In 2009, Adorus travelled to Tanzania with Emwazi and Schrodl, an Islamic convert who may have used the alias Umar and who described himself as a translator. The trio thought to have approached Cage about their 2009 treatment in Amsterdam, after their deportation from Tanzania. The group reported that they and Emwazi were 'repeatedly harassed' by the Dutch and British authorities. Cage compiled a report in which it accused their interrogators of comparing Muslims and Islam to dogs and terrorism. The group said that Adorus had been told by security service officers that 'our details will be passed to the secret services of the whole world'.", "answer": ["Ali Adorus was questioned alongside Mohammed Emwazi in 2009 .\nPair were detained and deported after raising suspicions for visiting .\nThe 33-year-old was jailed last year in Ethiopia for four-and-a-half years .\nAuthorities say he was hoping to establish Islamic rule through 'terrorism'"], "label": "SUM"}

Mr Clarkson is an Oxfordshire neighbour and family friend of the Camerons. Scroll down for video . David Cameron's daughter Nancy, 11, ‘threatened to go on hunger strike’ unless Jeremy Clarkson is restored as Top Gear host . Despite the 'threat', which her parents have joked about, Nancy appeared to be enjoying dinner with her family . The PM told the BBC: ‘Nancy has threatened to go on hunger strike unless Jeremy Clarkson is restored. ‘I’ve told her this is not necessarily a useful intervention. It’s not exactly Gandhi, we had a discussion about this this morning.’ Samantha Cameron chipped in: ‘Nancy’s hunger strike this morning lasted approximately five minutes’. The Prime Minister quipped: ‘It’s between lunch and tea is the way it works.’ During the interview, Mr Cameron and BBC Political Editor James Landale went to a local butcher near his constituency home in Witney, Oxfordshire. They then went back to Mr Cameron’s home where the PM was interviewed while preparing food in his kitchen. Clarkson was suspended two weeks ago following allegations of 'a fracas' with Top Gear producer Oisin Tymon (right), prompting the top-rating show to be pulled off air . Nancy's siblings Florence (left) and Elwen tuck into a dinner of cold meats and a healthy salad, prepared by Mr Cameron . Mr Cameron was seen visiting a butchers shop in his Witney constituency, and joking about 'juicy thighs' In the shop, Mr Cameron chose some chicken, saying: ‘I like the thighs because they’re very juicy.’ He also denied being the shop’s most famous customer, pointing out ‘Mr Clarkson pops in from time to time doesn’t he?’. Mr Cameron said it was very important to him that his children ‘feel very rooted and grounded’ in Oxfordshire. One of his children, he said, calls 10 Downing Street ‘the pretend home’. The interview appeared to show Mr Cameron’s kitchen contains a red chopping board emblazoned with ‘Calm Down Dear’ The PM was accused of sexism in 2011 after using that slogan, taken from a TV advert, against Labour front bencher Angela Eagle. Mr Cameron has previously said his children would be ‘heartbroken’ if Top Gear was taken off air. When details of the incident emerged, he backed calls for Mr Clarkson to be reinstated. ‘Because he is such a huge talent and he amuses and entertains so many people, including my children, who’d be heartbroken if Top Gear was taken off air, I hope this can be sorted out,’ he said.", "answer": ["Nancy Cameron is campaigning against Clarkson's suspension, PM said .\nShe 'threatened to go on hunger strike' unless he is restored to Top Gear .\nDavid Cameron joked that his daughter's threat is 'not exactly Gandhi'\nSamantha Cameron said Nancy's hunger strike only 'lasted five minutes'\nTop Gear host is an Oxfordshire neighbour and friend of the Camerons .\nClarkson was suspended by the BBC over alleged 'fracas' with a producer ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "They are two of the nation's most famous scientists, famed for their ground-breaking work in the world of physics. But now, Professors Stephen Hawking and Brian Cox also share the honour of becoming fully fledged brands by turning their names into trademarks. Hawking, 73, whose life was played out in the successful biopic The Theory of Everything released this year, has applied to the Intellectual Property Office to have his name formally registered. Cox, 47, the Human Universe presenter, has already made the move. Professor Hawking has turned his name into a brand to prevent inappropriate retailers exploiting it . Online retailers, such as the site Redbubble, sell T shirts featuring a zombie Stephen Hawking above the words 'Hawking Dead' There is a wide range of Stephen Hawking memorabilia online, many of which include corny catchphrases . This will enable the pair to sell their brands for anything from greetings cards to disability aids to set up an educational charity. The principle reason behind Professor Hawking's move to trademark his name is for charitable purposes. It will give him the option of setting up a foundation, such as one promoting physics or for research into motor neurone disease, which has left him paralysed since he was diagnosed aged 21, in 1963. The move will also prevent others from exploiting his name with inappropriate products and sees him join the ranks of celebrities who have turned their names into brands, such as JK Rowling and David Beckham. There is a wide range of Professor Hawking memorabilia available on the internet, including a thong with his quote 'while there may be primitive life in our region of the galaxy, there don't seem to be any advanced intelligent beings', inked on the front. There is also a pair of boxer shorts, available for £8, with a cartoon sketch of the scientist on and T shirts featuring a zombie Professor Hawking above the words 'Hawking Dead'. A spokesman for Cambridge University, where he is a director of research at the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, told the Sunday Times: 'It's a personal matter, it is not a university issue, but he has taken measures to protect his name and the success it has brought.'

{"question": "Daily paracetamol could raise the risk of heart attacks, stroke and early death, a major study has warned . Daily paracetamol could raise the risk of heart attacks, stroke and early death, a major study warns today. It found that patients prescribed high doses of the painkiller for long periods were up to 63 per cent more likely to die unexpectedly. The risk of having a heart attack or stroke was up to 68 per cent higher and there was an almost 50 per cent greater chance of having a stomach ulcer or bleed. Paracetamol is considered by doctors to be safer than aspirin, which can cause stomach bleeds, and ibuprofen, which has been linked to heart attacks and strokes. But British researchers who looked at studies involving 666,000 patients say the risks may have been underestimated and are calling for a major review to be conducted into the drug’s safety. They think paracetamol may be causing illness by preventing the action of an enzyme in the body called COX-2. Scientists from the Leeds Institute of Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Medicine looked at eight studies that contained information on patients taking paracetamol daily for up to 14 years, for conditions such as arthritis and severe back pain. They also covered patients who took the medicine less often or hardly at all. Philip Conaghan, who led the research, pointed out that for most patients the risks were very small and those given paracetamol over a long period would have illnesses likely to kill them early. For this reason it was difficult to be sure the drugs were causing problems. But the professor added: ‘I am a bit worried that paracetamol at high dose for long periods could be associated with side effects that we hadn’t previously associated.’ He said patients being prescribed the drugs for long periods for arthritis or muscle and joint pain should talk to their doctor about alternative treatments, such as exercise. Published in the journal, Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases, the study concluded: ‘Given its high usage and availability, a systematic review of paracetamol’s efficacy and tolerability in individual conditions is warranted.’ Professor Conaghan said it was not possible from the studies to work out how the average person’s lifetime risk of a heart attack or stroke would increase if they took paracetamol for a long period. The risk of having a heart attack or stroke was up to 68 per cent higher and there was an almost 50 per cent greater chance of having a stomach ulcer or bleed, for those who took the drug for longer periods . Statistically, one in six men and one in ten women will die from heart attacks, strokes and other complications of heart disease. Other scientists played down the risks. Professor Nick Bateman, who specialises in clinical toxicology at the University of Edinburgh, said: ‘Based on this study the risk is minimal. Paracetamol remains the safest analgesic available, and this study should not stop people taking it. ‘Based on these results, the lowest effective dose for the shortest necessary period is advised, this is common sense for all medicines.’ Paracetamol is the most commonly used painkiller in the UK and 22.5million prescriptions are handed out each year. A further 200million packs are sold over the counter. Although the NHS does not keep figures, evidence from Canada suggests that 5 per cent of the population are given at least one high dose prescription of paracetamol over the course of a year. A 2013 Oxford study warned that for every 1,000 patients on ibuprofen or a similar drug, three would suffer a heart attack within a year, of which one would be fatal.", "answer": ["Those taking drug for long periods up to 63% more likely to die suddenly .\nTheir risk of a heart attack or a stroke is also up to 68% higher, study warns .\nBritish researchers behind study now calling for major review into drug .\nThey say drug may be causing illness by inhibiting enzyme called COX-2 ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "A young woman was run over by two taxis and killed in front of her boyfriend as they walked home together following a drunken tiff. Megan Hoskins, 20, was heard to shout at soldier Mark Hughes: 'just watch... the next car that comes' before apparently laying down in the road. As Mr Hughes, also 20, tried to tend to her, a black Hackney cab ran over her, closely followed by a Skoda Octavia minicab which tried to brake but came to rest with the care assistant trapped underneath. Megan Hoskins, right, was out with boyfriend Mark Hughes, left, on the night she died on July 20, last . The inquest heard that Ms Hoskins had taken cocaine, alcohol and cannabis on the night she had died . She was rushed to hospital but died of multiple fatal injuries less than two hours later. The tragedy occurred on July 20 last year while Megan, from Wigan, Greater Manchester was spending the weekend with Mr Hughes, who was on home leave from duty in Afghanistan. An inquest heard the couple who were planning to move in together had watched a movie before going to a friend's house where they drank a bottle of rosé wine each and three cans of Fosters lager. Ms Hoskins also took some cocaine with friends before their group travelled to the Newtown Working Men's Club in Wigan. Trouble began when Mr Hughes became angry over a man trying to dance with Ms Hoskins. They left at around midnight and continued the argument on the way home, where witnesses saw Ms Hoskins walking in front of and then behind her boyfriend. Mr Hughes told the Bolton hearing: 'A man had came over to dance with Megan and I said \"that's my girl, what are you doing?\" It did wind me up. I knew she wouldn't do anything but it did wind me up. We had a bit of an argument and decided to leave. Mr Hughes, right, got annoyed while out with Ms Hoskins, left, when a man approached her for a dance . A witness who overheard the row saw Ms Hughes lie down in the road, pictured, and shout 'watch now, the next car that comes' as a Fire Engine approached, which managed to avoid her but  was hit by a hackney taxi . 'We decided to walk home and were having a dispute, a stupid argument like couples do but nothing serious. I was jealous and it wound me up and we were having a go at each other. At some point walking home I made a comment and she laughed. 'We were crossing over the road and she was stood at the side of me to my right. I crossed over the road then turned to the left to grab her hand and turned round to see her and it took three or four seconds to figure where she was. I saw her lying in the road and that's when the cars have come.' Mr Hughes said he didn't hear Ms Hoskins fall or hear her shout for help and added: 'That's what I can't get out of my head. She would normally only fall over if she had heels on but she didn't have heels on. She didn't say anything. 'She would usually have a go at me if it was my fault. There was nothing.' Mr Hughes, pictured, said Ms Hoskins normally only ever fell over when out  if she was wearing high heels . Asked whether he thought she lay there intentionally, Mr Hughes replied: 'I have thought that but she wouldn't have any reason to do that. Ours was a loving relationship and she was my best friend. She was always laughing and joking and she was a bubbly young lady. I had returned from work that weekend and planned to spend it with her.' Eyewitness Amy Howarth who was having a cigarette from her bedroom window said she heard raised voices and saw a young couple in the road below. She said: 'I could hear them shouting. 'When they reached my house the male crossed the road and at this point the female ran on to the road and passed him to get in front. She was in the road in the path of cars then shouted \"watch now, the next car that comes\". She carried on walking in the road. I could see a fire engine going to a call with its blue lights on. I thought it was going to hit her.' Ian Dunham, the driver of the fire engine said: 'I saw a person in the road. I turned the sirens off, I didn't swerve, and went on the wrong side of the road to give that person room. I knew they had had a drink so not to startle them I turned the siren off. 'I noticed it was a female and as we were travelling up I was watching where she was and she continued to walk not in the middle of the road but about a car's width from the pavement.' The inquest heard the driver black Hackney cab Brian Sharples could not have avoided a collision. Coroner Rachael Griffin returned an open conclusion after the inquest describing Ms Hoskins as 'caring' Joseph Parkinson the driver of the Skoda Octavia following behind him said: 'The taxi in front didn't so much swerve as rock. When the lights came on I took my foot off the accelerator and then without warning at all there was a figure in the road. I hit the brakes as hard as I could. I didn't have time to swerve. If I could have done, I would have done.' The hearing was told Ms Hoskins had studied health and social care after leaving school in order to help people. Tests showed she had traces of cocaine, cannabis and alcohol in her blood at the time of death which may have affected her judgement. Mr Hughes was initially arrested on suspicion of Ms Hoskins' manslaughter but no action was taken against him. Recording an open conclusion, coroner Rachael Griffin said: 'She was very clearly a bubbly young lady who was intelligent, bright and spent her life caring for others. In Miss Howarth's opinion, she believes Megan was deliberately standing in front of cars. We have heard from Mark that that didn't happen. 'I don't know how or why she was in the road. It could have been that she fell, although she would normally fall if wearing heels. It could have been that she collapsed. It could have been that she was purposefully lying in the road. 'Sadly for unknown reasons to me, through collapse or choice, Megan was lying in the road in the path of oncoming vehicles. The difficulty I have is I don't know why she was on the floor.

The French were less dominant in the second half and their penalty claims were waived away after Lacazette took a tumble in the area between two Danish players. Saint-Etienne keeper Stephane Ruffier enjoyed a quiet evening but made two decisive saves after the hour-mark, denying Christian Eriksen's shot and another effort from Bendtner when the visitors enjoyed a spell of dominance.

{"question": "(CNN)Seeing a rainbow often fills people with a sense of joy, regardless of whether it is their first or 19th time witnessing the colorful creation. Rainbow Gatherings -- annual events that take place throughout the world -- encompass a vibrant mixture of the environment and people to produce a similar feeling of excitement. Photographer Matjaz Krivic's \"Somewhere Under the Rainbow\" series was shot over 19 years at Rainbow Gatherings in various countries. According to Krivic, the meaning behind the name of the events originates from an ancient Hopi Native American prophecy about \"Rainbow Warriors.\" Rainbow Gatherings involve a temporary community of people who meet to share their similar ideals -- peace, harmony, freedom and respect. Those participating in the gatherings collectively refer to themselves as a \"Rainbow Family.\" The community, which welcomes a wide spectrum of ages, comes together to embrace nature and establish an alternative space away from society's popular culture of consumerism, materialism and mass media. Those who attend are not required to pay any form of money, not even for food, and the gatherings do not have rigid structures of dominance nor one specific leader. Instead, Rainbow Gatherings are essentially idealistic movements driven by the convergence of its community's beliefs in a more equitable society and its people's love and tolerance for one another. \"The magic hat goes around and you put money if you have or if you want,\" Krivic said. \"(But) nobody needs to pay for the food. Everybody is welcome to go and eat there.\" Krivic says that Rainbow Gatherings also tend to take place in regions of the world that \"need to be healed\" after having experienced devastating conflicts. Past gatherings include those held in Serbia, Bosnia and Ukraine. \"I really don't like what's going on in this world. ... There's just so much stuff happening,\" Krivic said. \"You can always go to (Rainbow Gatherings) and stay there and have a nice time, and you don't even have to pay for it. It will be a nice time, nice energy, not aggressive.\" One of the most enjoyable aspects about Rainbow Gatherings is the many workshops and activities that are available, where people engage in and learn about everything from yoga and tai chi to meditation and healing techniques. Another significant part of Rainbow Gatherings is the all-encompassing sound. \"I like the music, I'm an audiophile. I like all sorts of music, but when I go there it's live, it's there,\" Krivic said. \"It's like two guys playing and eventually it's like 50 people playing and the music is just so beautiful.\" The first Rainbow Gathering took place in Colorado in 1972, and it is believed to have been organized by youth counterculture \"tribes\" from Northern California and the Pacific Northwest. Since then, the gatherings have extended to other areas in the United States as well as a number of different countries. The international gatherings generally take place during the summer, before August's full moon. According to Krivic, the exact locations of some of the Rainbow Gatherings are revealed through hand-drawn maps and presented to those who have attended a gathering in the past. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. Krivic has had a diverse range of experiences at Rainbow Gatherings, and maintaining a consistent photographic process over the years has enabled him to witness firsthand the growth of his photography. Ever since his first Rainbow Gathering, Krivic has been using the same two film cameras and lenses. \"The gatherings didn't change,\" Krivic said, \"but my photography did change -- a lot. ... I consider photography differently now.\" Krivic says a key consideration when taking photos was the use of film cameras as opposed to digital, which he believes do not fit in with the atmosphere of the gatherings. He also had to carefully decide who to photograph. \"I had some friends and I could take photos of them, and then eventually when I was going on and on, it just became like a family,\" he said. \"It's like people that you know for 20 years and you see them every year.\" Just as every person sees a rainbow in their own unique way, \"Somewhere Under the Rainbow\" enables viewers to let their vision roam freely around every corner of the photos, leaving them to cultivate their own perspectives and ripen their imaginations. In one photo, Krivic takes viewers to Pakistan in 1998, where a man mesmerizes viewers as he stands in pristine blue water holding a mango in his hands. It's then 2003 in France. Light rays power through colossal trees, illuminating tents and tepees and dosing the atmosphere with warmth. Viewers later discover a delicate morning hug between a man and woman at last year's Rainbow Gathering in Hungary, with a sunflower softly blooming out of a ukulele. As for Krivic, he feels that \"Somewhere Under the Rainbow\" is not finished and will never be. \"I will never complete it. I will always go because I like it,\" he said. \"I will take photos again of friends, and just go on with it.\" Matjaz Krivic is a photographer based in Slovenia.

{"question": "His arms out-stretched in a hero pose, former international footballer Michael McIndoe milks the adulation as a spray of champagne washes over him. The 35-year-old wasn't celebrating a cup triumph but the millions flowing through his accounts from an alleged £30million investment scheme that snared a string of top-flight players. Pictures have now emerged of McIndoe in 2011 - at the height of his scheme - surrounded by beautiful women and empty champagne bottles as he revelled in a millionaire playboy's lifestyle in Marbella with a limitless credit card and wads of cash. Former Wolves and  Coventry player Michael McIndoe celebrates in Marbella during the height of his scheme .

McIndoe (second from the right) parties in Marbella using money earned from the elaborate scheme . McIndoe started out at Luton Town, making his debut in 1998 and playing for the Hatters 39 times before joining Hereford on a free in 2000. Yeovil then took advantage of the Bulls' financial plight and snapped him up for £25,000 the following year. He scored 22 goals in 91 outings for the Glovers, winning promotion from the Conference in 2003 before joining Doncaster for £50,000. McIndoe twice made the PFA Team of the Year with Rovers and was his side's joint-top scorer in 2004-05 with 12 goals. He twice represented the Scotland B side during his time at Rovers. After a loan spell at Derby he joined Barnsley then Wolves, on loan again, before the deal was made permanent for £250,000. He signed a three-year contract with Bristol City in 2007 and scored the winner against Crystal Palace in the second leg of the 2008 Championship play-off semi-final. They lost out to Hull at Wembley and McIndoe had one more season at Ashton Gate before joining Coventry. He also had a brief loan stint at MK Dons. But the former Wolves and Coventry midfielder, who is accused of persuading 300 stars including Jimmy Bullard as well as a string of lower league players to invest with him, is now being investigated by police. He was forced into a bankruptcy court with debts approaching £3m earlier this month where he claimed to be penniless and living on the charity of friends and family. The Metropolitan Police are investigating and have started quizzing victims and associates. 'He was the Mr Big in Marbella, buying loads of champagne and girls all over the place. He even had a bodyguard,' said one footballer, who lost around £75,000 in the scheme, which promised a 20 per cent return on investments. McIndoe, from Edinburgh, hired pop star Alexandra Burke to perform at a party and invested in a private members club, in London. But it was in Marbella that McIndoe indulged the lavish lifestyle - shown in these exclusive photos - he could not afford as his playing career ended in non-league football. He hired a modernist £2m mansion for £27,000-a-week for a three-week holiday spree and spent £40,000 on champagne in one day at a beach club party. Friends had bottles of champagne and vodka at their tables whenever they went to nightclubs. McIndoe celebrates scoring for Doncaster against Arsenal in the League Cup in 2005 .

The former Scotland B player rented a £27,000-a-week mansion for a three-week holiday in Spain . 'There were lots of girls and lots of drink,' said the player, who had been befriended by McIndoe when he was a young apprentice at the same club. 'He was spending money like you've never seen before.' McIndoe was photographed lounging on a white sofa with his then girlfriend, model Emma Frain, and smoking a huge cigar while surrounded by friends as he bankrolled their luxury holidays. The player added that McIndoe targeted fellow professionals and businessmen football supporters and initially gave them the 20 per cent return paid monthly in cash. The scheme sucked in around 300 players and the former QPR and Hull star Bullard is thought to have lost around £600,000 which prompted him to go on the ITV reality show, I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here. He told original investors to get other 'clients' involved and they would be rewarded.

McIndoe lived at the five-star Mayfair Hotel, paying £4,000 a week for a suite, and also rented a Belgravia apartment for an upfront £150,000 annual fee, it is alleged. He ran glitzy parties at celebrity nightclubs including Funky Buddha, in London, and drove around in a Bentley and a Maybach. He was reportedly gambling heavily before the scheme crashed and is said to have run through £1m on bets with one bookmaker in a year. 'He had the gift of the gab but was very cagey about the scheme, saying the money was in property, gold or City investments,' added the player, who declined to be named. 'People were convinced when they saw him paying out but then he suddenly closed the scheme down. He kept telling me to wait and that I would be a wealthy man.' McIndoe celebrates sinking Crystal Palace to reach Wembley in 2008 . But he was consoled by Wayne Brown after Bristol City lost the 2008 Championship Play-off final to Hull . Another person to have been caught out by the former Scotland B international was glamour model Georgia Eden, who was one of 30 women hired to attend club nights organised by McIndoe. In total, McIndoe was due to pay the model agency who organised the women £12,000, but the money never materialised. Speaking to the Daily Record, Eden said: 'We were asked to mingle around and talk to guests in the club. The organisers said they were really pleased with what we had done and we were told we would be paid within 30 days. Georgia Eden was one of 30 models hired to attend a event put on at a club by McIndoe . But Eden, along with her colleagues, was never paid for her work with the agency said to be owed £12,000 . McIndoe (right) in action playing for his former club Wolves against West Bromwich Albion in 2007 . 'That date came and went and a lot of excuses were made to the agency. 'To have that amount of girls booked for one job was a really big deal so it was a big let down to not be paid for the work we had done.' McIndoe was made bankrupt in October last year with disclosed debts of £2.4m. He told the London bankruptcy court this month that he had no income and was living off £13,900 surplus from the sale of his mother's house but £6,000 of that had been given to his girlfriend, who lives in Epping, Essex. 'That money has been running thin of late so I have been getting help from friends and family,' he told the hearing. He added that he was not working and was living with his mother in Edinburgh or staying with a friend in London. After the hearing, he faced accusations from creditors that he had not responded to their questions about repayment. 'I have nothing to say, I cannot comment about this,' he said. The hearing was adjourned until March 25 and he must attend a meeting with the bankruptcy trustee later this month.

{"question": "New Delhi, India (CNN)A mob, consisting of thousands of people, stormed a prison compound in India's far northeast, dragging out a rape suspect before beating him to death on the streets on Thursday, authorities say. Police say they tried to stave off the mob with tear gas and opened fire, killing one person. The crowd targeted a 35-year-old suspect, identified as an undocumented Bangladeshi settler, who died of his injuries before officers could rescue him, said L.L. Doungal, the director-general of police in the remote Nagaland state, where the attack took place. The mob that broke into the main jail in the state's Dimapur district was comprised of \"thousands\" of people, Doungal told CNN. \"Many of them were students in uniform,\" he said. The suspect was accused of raping a local woman on February 23. Tensions between the native Naga and undocumented Bangladeshi migrants in the district have been simmering for some time, police said. On Thursday evening, thousands of people who were demanding the cancellation of trade permits for Bengali-speaking settlers, tore into the prison complex and pulled the suspect out. Police initially used tear gas and bamboo canes to rescue the inmate, but were not successful, Doungal said. \"There were students in uniform. So, we had to use minimum force,\" he said.

{"question": "An ex-CFO and Chick-fil-A protestor who lost his job after posting a video rant against one of the chain's employees  has since lost his home and lives on food stamps. Adam Mark Smith, 37, who worked for an Arizona-based medical device manufacturer, was shamed after the 2012 YouTube video was posted showing him berating employee Rachel Elizabeth. The video which expressed his disdain over the firm's anti-gay marriage stance went viral, and left him unemployed and forced to lose his home. Nearly three years later, the married father of four is still searching for a job and his family previously had to give away possessions before he was hired and fired again, according to ABC. Scroll down for video . Adam Smith was the former CFO of an Arizona-based medical device manufacturer, before he was fired after posting a video of himself berating a Chick-fil-A employee for the fast-food chain's anti-gay marriage stance . Three years later from the viral video that shook his life from riches to rags, the married father of four is still searching for a job (Smith above with his family) At the time he was working as CFO for Vante, Smith was earning $200,000 annually and had more than $1million in stock options, but he said it was all taken from him when he was fired. His 2012 firing was reported on the same day as the counter-protest against Chick-fil-A's Appreciation Day as thousands of gay couples flocked to restaurants to kiss during the summer of 2012. Things were looking rough for Smith and his wife, Amy, along with their four sons after they lost their home and moved into an RV. But there was silver lining for him and the chance for a new start when he was offered a new job as a CFO in Portland a few months later. 'I felt like, \"yeah, I got it. I am back'',' he said. However, nearly two weeks later, he was fired once again after his boss realized he was the man from the video. In the 2012 video that went viral, he told Chick-fil-A employee Rachel Elizabeth while at the drive-thru window that he did not know how she lived with herself and worked there . Smith posted a follow-up video apologizing to Elizabeth (above) which she accepted . As the incident continues to haunt him, he said he does not regret the stand he took but he regrets the way he spoke to Elizabeth. While Smith is unsure if the incident will ever go away, he has turned to meditation, and has written a memoir, A Million Dollar Cup of Water: Discovering the Wealth in Authenticity. The controversy surrounding one of America's biggest fast-food chains began in 2012 after a series of anti-same sex marriage statements from Chick-fil-A's COO Dan T. Cathy. Local media had previously reported that the company, founded in 1946 by Cathy’s father, S. Truett Cathy, sponsored several organisations and group which actively oppose LGBT rights and same-sex marriage. Chick-fil-A donated more than $3million between 2003 and 2009 to Christian organizations with a well-known anti-gay agenda, and in 2010 alone Chick-fil-A gave nearly $2million to such causes, according to reports. In June and July 2012, Dan Cathy made several statements against gay marriage. When asked about Chick-fil-A’s backing of ‘traditional’ families with a husband and wife, Cathy responded 'Well, guilty as charged’. He also stated that Chick-fil-A is runs on 'traditional Christian values' and is 'very much supportive of the family — the biblical definition of the family unit'. In response, gay rights protesters launched nationwide boycotts and staged same-sex 'kiss-ins' at Chick-fil-A stores across the country. The book tells of how his backlash from the public took him from riches to rags, to 'true wealth'. In job interviews Smith is honest about the video, he said, but he thinks employers are scared to hire him because they think it could possibly reoccur again. In the original video posted three years ago, Smith waits in line for a free promotional water at a Chick-fil-A before expressing his disdain for the firm's support for traditional Christian marriage. Filmed by Smith on his own phone, the former CFO gets to the window of the drive-thru and starts to all-out bully the young female employee behind the counter, who remains calm and polite throughout the whole exchange. He said: 'I don't know how you live with yourself and work here. I don't understand it. This is a horrible corporation with horrible values.' Elizabeth tells him repeatedly to have a nice day and that it is a pleasure to serve him as well as saying: 'I'm staying neutral on this subject. My personal beliefs don't belong in the workplace.' As he drives off he tells the worker: 'I'm a nice guy by the way, and I'm totally heterosexual. Just can't stand the hate. It's gotta stop guys, stand up.' Once he posted the video and went back to work, he said his employees were shocked. Smith told 20/20: 'I got into work and the receptionist, the first thing, big eyes, 'Adam, what did you do?', she said. 'The voicemail is completely full, and it's full of bomb threats.'' After the video went viral, according to a MarketWire statement, Smith was fired from his job at Vante, Inc. They released a statement saying: 'The actions of Mr Smith do not reflect our corporate values in any manner. Vante is an equal opportunity company with a diverse workforce, which holds diverse opinions. In his apology video, Smith told Elizabeth he was sorry for the way he spoke to her and that she handled the situation with dignity and grace . Wanda Flory, of Swanton, Ohio, center, watches with Terry, (left), and her husband Richard, (center right), as Thea Grabiec, (right), kisses Sarah Shovan during the counter-protest against Chick-fil-A's Appreciation Day . Smith also told Elizabeth in his apology video that he was angry by the number of people who were supporting Chick-fil-A during the Appreciation Day and became unraveled . 'We respect the right of our employees and all Americans to hold and express their personal opinions, however, we also expect our company officers to behave in a manner commensurate with their position and in a respectful fashion that conveys these values of civility with others.' After losing his job at Vante, Smith removed his original video from YouTube and posted an eight-minute video apology to Elizabeth. 'I am so very sorry for the way I spoke to you,' said Smith in the video. 'You handled my frustrating rant with such dignity and composure. 'Every time I watch the video I am blown away by really the beauty in what you did, and your kindness, and your patience with me.' Smith explained that he was enraged by the number of people that had come out to support the chicken fast-food firm during last weeks 'Chick-fil-A's Appreciation Day' and lost his cool. Shown Smith's apology by an anchor on Fox News at the time, Elizabeth accepted it. She said: 'I do forgive him. I think he realizes how bad it was to make that tape.

{"question": "Eminent psychologist Dr. Phil McGraw, known to TV audiences as Dr. Phil, is on his way to Atlanta, Georgia to help the beleaguered boyfriend of Bobbi Kristina, Daily Mail Online has learned exclusively. On the eve of Bobbi Kristina’s 22nd birthday yesterday Gordon, whose social media presence had become increasingly desperate and erratic tweeted, “I’m so hurt I wanna do myself in, I know I have to strong [sic].’ In an insight into his spiraling mental state, on Tuesday he tweeted ‘You all blame me but I tried my best and it wasn’t good enough sorry. ‘ Earlier he tweeted the simple plea to Bobbi Kristina, ‘I love you soooooooo much plz wake up.’ Through it all, he has not been allowed to visit with her, as tensions between Gordon and the Brown family have escalated . On the edge: Nick Gordon was seen on outside North Fulton Hospital near Atlanta, where Bobbi Kristina was first taken after she was found unconscious face down in her bathtub . A helping hand: Dr. Phil is concerned about Nick Gordon and his on his way to offer assistance . It is five weeks since Bobbi Kristina was found facedown and unresponsive in a bathtub at the Roswell, Georgia, home she and Gordon, 25, shared. The only daughter of Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown has been in a medically induced coma ever since the horrific discovery just weeks from the third anniversary of her mother’s death in eerily similar circumstances. The singer was found dead in a bathtub in her hotel near Los Angeles on 11 February 2012 just hours before she was due to attend a pre Grammy awards party. But unlike Houston’s death that was ruled accidental, police are treating Bobbi Kristina’s near drowning and injuries allegedly sustained by the 21-year-old as a criminal investigation. Two weeks after being admitted to Atlanta’s Emory Hospital Bobbi Kristina was taken off her ventilator and had her breathing tube removed for fear of infection. Instead she was given a tracheotomy. But any hopes that this was a sign of her condition improving were dealt a devastating blow the following week when medics attempted to bring her out of her coma only for her to suffer a series of dangerous seizures. While Bobbi Kristina fights for her life a troubling picture of her relationship with Gordon, of drug use and domestic turbulence in the weeks leading up to the incident, has emerged. It was Gordon who found Bobbi Kristina and who was administering CPR when first responders arrived on the scene. But other than this, few details have emerged. There have been reports that Bobbi Kristina was under the influence of drugs and drinking heavily on the morning that she was found face down and unresponsive in the tub. Nick and Bobbi Kristina in happier times. Gordon has been banned from seeing her by the Brown family . In addition to this she had been using cocaine, heroin and Xanax in the months before the January 31 incident according to multiple sources who spoke to People. Just two weeks ago Gordon was forced to admit that police suspected drugs at the Bobbi Kristina and his Georgia home – a home owned by Houston until her death – as he gave up a legal battle to block law enforcement from obtaining CCTV footage from security cameras located at the Roswell residence. Lawyers for Gordon had tried to argue that the warrant issued on February 12 was an infringement of their client’s privacy but they subsequently dropped the case. Meanwhile the nature of Gordon and Bobbi Kristina’s union has come under intense scrutiny. Both have referred to each other as ‘husband’ and ‘wife’ in recent months but there is no evidence to support the assertion that Gordon – who was unofficially adopted into the family by Houston when he was 14 – has married the girl who he once knew as a ‘sister.’ In his most recent tweets Gordon who had previously called Bobbi Kristina his ‘wife’ refers to her as his ‘fiancée.’ What is clear is that, in the weeks leading up to the incident that has left Bobbi Kristina fighting for her life, her life had become increasingly chaotic. Just four days before she was found in the bathtub she was involved in a car wreck when she lost control of her silver Jeep Liberty and drove headlong into a gray Ford Taurus. The driver of the Ford and a passenger in her Jeep were injured and taken to hospital according to a report from police at Roswell, Georgia. Gordon too had been involved in crashes and speeding offenses in the past months. Police were also called to her home on January 23 after reports of a fight there. A security guard at the gated community where Bobbi Kristina lives told a dispatcher that one of her neighbors reported people ‘hitting each other and swinging’ outside the three-bedroom townhouse. Officers attended the scene but found no signs of an altercation. Speaking to Daily Mail Online a former boyfriend of Bobbi Kristina who remains a close friend, Zach Jafarzedeh gave an insight into the torrid pair. He said: ‘Nick has a short temper and Bobbi can be difficult. ‘It was a tug of war, because they are both very stubborn people. Bobbie is very sweet, giving and caring, but she wants all of you, everything. ‘And Nick like space, that’s where a lot of the tension between them came from.’ He revealed that Gordon was ‘getting a little wild.’ He said: ‘He was getting into car accidents. He’s been in about three or four accidents over the last couple of years. He’s got a need for speed. He’s getting these nice cars now the trust fund money is coming in [from Bobbi, sole inheritor of Whitney’s estate] and crashing them life and right. ‘He had a couple of Chevrolet Camaros. He liked fast cars, BMWs, that kind of thing. He cares, but he wasn’t slowing down.’ Against this backdrop, hostilities between Gordon and Bobbi Kristina’s father, Bobby Brown, and other family members have publicly exploded with Gordon an increasingly isolated and ostracized figure. Gordon has accused Brown of only being after his daughter’s money and he himself has been accused of that very same thing in return. Bobby Kristina’s aunt Marion ‘Pat’ Houston is the executor Whitney’s estate estimated at between $12 and $20million trust She took out a restraining order against Gordon in March citing aggressive remarks and tweets he had made and claiming that he was only interested in Bobbi Kristina because of her money. According to Pat the tweets, including one that read ‘Loam I got bigger guns than you. Watch them react to this,’ were specifically aimed at threatening her. Pat, who was one of Whitney’s managers, has made no secret of her disapproval of Bobbi Kristina and Gordon’s ‘sibling’ relationship having turned into something romantic. In increasingly erratic tweets Gordon has raged against singer Bobby Brown accusing him of being an absent father who has barely seen his daughter in the past four or five years. He has claimed that the responsibility for looking after both Whitney, who struggled with drug abuse, and Bobbi Kristina fell on his shoulders and that, now just 25, it was too great a duty to bear.", "answer": ["On the eve of Bobbi Kristina’s 22nd birthday yesterday Nick Gordon's tweets have become increasingly desperate and erratic .\nFriends and family are concerned about Gordon's mental health .\nThey believe Dr. Phil can help Gordon .\nGordon has not been allowed to visit with Bobbi Kristina, as tensions between Gordon and the Brown family have escalated ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "(CNN)Newly released al Qaeda documents, including letters to and from Osama bin Laden in the year or so before his May 2011 death, show an organization that understood it had severe problems resulting from the CIA drone program that was killing many of the group's leaders in Pakistan's tribal regions bordering Afghanistan. As a result of this pressure, al Qaeda officials were seriously considering relocating elements of the organization to other countries such as Afghanistan or Iran. They also entered into ceasefire discussions through intermediaries with elements of Pakistan's intelligence service, ISI, although the documents suggest that nothing came of these discussions and there is no evidence in the documents indicating that the Pakistani government had any clue about bin Laden's location or presence in Pakistan. CIA efforts to spy on the group and kill its leaders were so effective that in June 2010 an al Qaeda official urged bin Laden, \"You should have fewer exchanges of correspondence with us during this period. Make the period between contacts longer and further apart. Take excessive caution and care, especially this year.\" This was wise counsel. Within a few weeks of this letter being written, the CIA would track bin Laden's trusted courier to his longtime hideout in Abbottabad, Pakistan, and on May 1, 2011, a U.S. Navy SEAL operation ordered by President Barack Obama killed al Qaeda's leader. The new al Qaeda documents are part of a trove of many thousands that the SEALs recovered at bin Laden's compound. Several were released during the Brooklyn trial last month of al Qaeda operative Abid Naseer. Seventeen of these documents had also been released around the first anniversary of bin Laden's death. It's long past time for the government to release more of these thousands of captured documents -- with any necessary redactions for national security purposes -- as they help us to understand better what precipitated the decline and fall of the terrorist group that once dominated the attention of the world, just as ISIS does today. The documents show how al Qaeda's 9/11 operation unleashed so much force against it, including the CIA drone program, that it had to hide in the shadows and couldn't pull off any successful operation in the West for many years before the death of bin Laden. The documents demonstrate that almost a decade after 9/11 al Qaeda was struggling to get any kind of operation going against Western targets. In a report on \"external operations,\" an al Qaeda official explained that a plot to attack the U.S. Embassy in Russia had fizzled and that despite sending al Qaeda members to the UK to hit \"several targets\" these operations had also come to nothing. Al Qaeda had also sent \"three brothers\" on a terrorist mission to Denmark, a country that bin Laden loathed because of the publication by a Danish newspaper of cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, but had \"lost contact with them.\" Given all the problems the group was having, an al Qaeda strategist suggested refocusing efforts on carrying out terrorist attacks using the \"simplest things such as  household knives, gas tanks, fuel, diesel and others like airplanes, trains and cars as  killing tools.\" 2011: U.S. offers details about bin Laden raid . A major theme of the documents is how much punishment the CIA drone program was inflicting on al Qaeda. Al Qaeda officials considered moving to Nuristan, a remote mountainous region of eastern Afghanistan, or to other parts of Pakistan such as Sindh or Balochistan and even to Iran, which had been a key sanctuary for a number of al Qaeda's leaders after the fall of the Taliban in late 2001. Al Qaeda mulled opening an office in Iran, but \"we backed off this idea due to financial costs and other considerations.\" In a letter to bin Laden, an al Qaeda official provided a vivid description of the death by drone of Mustafa Yazid, then the No. 3 leader of the group, on the night of May 22, 2010. The al Qaeda official wrote that Yazid was staying at the house of a \"well-known\" supporter of al Qaeda when a drone started making \"distinctive loops that we all know and all the brothers have experienced. They all know that if a plane starts doing these turns, it is going to strike.\" Yazid and his wife and three daughters and granddaughter were all killed in the drone strike, according to the official. The official lamented that drones are \"still circling our skies every day\" and the only relief from them came when weather conditions worsened and there was cloud cover. The official wrote but \"then they come back when the sky is clear.\" Al Qaeda had tried to use jamming technology and to hack into the drones \"but no result so far,\" according to the al Qaeda official. Underlining al Qaeda's weakness, during the summer of 2010 the group was contemplating some kind of ceasefire with the Pakistani government and had entered into negotiations with it via intermediaries to explain that al Qaeda's battle was \"primarily against the Americans. You became part of the battle when you sided with the Americans. If you were to leave us and our affairs alone, we would leave you alone.\" Highlights of bin Laden documents released in 2012 . The documents show that such a ceasefire was purely tactical rather than the beginning of some kind of rapprochement between al Qaeda and the Pakistanis. At one point an al Qaeda official referred to \"bin Laden's call to jihad against the apostate government of Pakistan.\" Apostasy is a grave crime in Islam and punishable by death in the eyes of members of al Qaeda. According to the documents, Pakistani intelligence officials \"reached out to\" al Qaeda through longtime jihadist sympathizers who had formerly held positions in the Pakistani intelligence agency, ISI, as well as the leaders of militant groups such as the Haqqani Taliban faction that have contacts with the ISI. The documents suggest that nothing came of these discussions, and there is no evidence in them that the Pakistanis had any idea that bin Laden was in Pakistan or indeed was even alive. Bergen in 2013: Bin Laden's life on the run . Moreover during the course of reporting the book \"Manhunt,\" about the CIA's long search for bin Laden, I spoke to several senior U.S. officials who said that the U.S. intelligence community was covertly monitoring the communications of Pakistani army chief Ashfaq Parvez Kayani and ISI director Ahmed Shuja Pasha the night of the bin Laden raid and they were both surprised about him being in Abbottabad. The documents did show one area of real success for al Qaeda, which was kidnapping for ransom, a tactic ISIS has been using so effectively. In 2008, al Qaeda had captured Afghanistan's former ambassador to Pakistan, Abdul Khaliq Farahi. After two years of negotiations he was exchanged for $5 million. An al Qaeda official told bin Laden that some of this money would be a \"gift\" to him \"from all the brothers.\" Bin Laden cautioned al Qaeda's leaders to be careful with the ransom money, as it might have to last the terrorist group several years. The documents show that al Qaeda's leaders were in contact with Tayeb Agha, a close aide to Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar. Agha has met with U.S. officials on a number of occasions to discuss peace negotiations. 2011: How U.S. forces killed Osama bin Laden . Far from the image of the isolated man in the cave that was prevalent before he was killed, the documents portray bin Laden as a hands-on manager of al Qaeda. In a 10-page letter that bin Laden wrote in August 2010, he had reams of advice for the al Qaeda-aligned group Al-Shabaab in Somalia, ordering that the group not attack Sufi Muslims in Somalia and also suggesting a plan to assassinate the President of neighboring Uganda who had sent his troops to fight Al-Shabaab. Bin Laden gave detailed notes about how Al-Shabaab could raise its agricultural output by using small dams for irrigation, and he suggested planting palm olive trees imported from Indonesia. He also advised Al-Shabaab against cutting down too many trees because it is \"dangerous for the environment of the region.\" Bin Laden had lived in nearby Sudan in the mid-'90s, establishing a number of business and farming enterprises. Bin Laden, something of a micromanager, told his top lieutenant to \"send us the resumes of all the brothers who may be nominated now or in the future for important management positions.\" He also cautioned against sending any emails, including even encrypted ones, urging that hand-delivered letters were the only safe method of communication. Bergen on 2012 documents: Seized documents show delusional leader and micromanager . Bin Laden also ordered that some of the tens of thousands of documents leaked by U.S. Army Pvt. Bradley Manning to WikiLeaks in 2010 be translated so that al Qaeda could better understand \"the enemy's policies in the region.\" And he suggested that his lieutenants reach out to Ahmed Zaidan, an Al Jazeera reporter based in Pakistan who had interviewed bin Laden in the past, so that he could have plenty of time to prepare a report to mark the 10th anniversary of 9/11. Bin Laden said he didn't want Zaidan to interview any members of his family, but he told his team to get in touch with the reporter \"promptly\" to get a sense of the questions he wanted bin Laden to answer. Bin Laden was killed four months before the 10th anniversary of 9/11. As the new al Qaeda documents make clear he died knowing that his dream of another terrorism spectacular in the West was just that: a dream. And the organization that he had founded was in deep trouble because of the CIA drone program.

{"question": "A London woman is embroiled in a fight for compensation with Jet Airways after toilets and sinks overflowed and smelly water seeped into the cabin during an eight-hour flight. Passengers, including two families with infant children, were forced to endure the pungent smell for about six hours as they travelled from Delhi to London. Traveller Amrita Jaurre snapped photos as water flowed into the aisles and rows, and cabin crew scrambled to contain the mess by piling newspapers on the floor. Photos show water trickling into the aisle (left) and newspapers that were used to soak up the mess (right) The 27-year-old office worker told MailOnline Travel: ‘After two hours, myself and other passengers noticed water seeping out from under the two lavatories closest to our seats. ‘We complained to the air steward who took no notice at first but once the overflow become more obvious, he realised we were not over exaggerating. ‘He then told us that the water was overflowing from the toilet and sink in both lavatories, so you can imagine the smell that we then had to endure for the remainder of the flight.’ She added: ‘It was quite difficult to tell whether the liquid contained human waste, but it would not surprise me as … the liquid overflowing from the lavatories definitely had a foul urine-like smell.’ Passengers were forced to cover their mouths and noses with scarves or clothing to escape the stench. However, the airline claims the water was simply leaking from sinks. Passengers used articles of clothing to cover their mouths and noses as water flowed into the cabin . In an attempt to cover the smell a flight attendant sprayed the wet patches with an air freshener. Amrita said: ‘This then led to complaints from a nearby passenger who suffered from asthma and couldn't be near such a strong fragrance without risking an asthma attack. ‘After this, the flight attendant went back to check on the lavatories and almost gagged when he opened the door so I can only imagine the state of the toilets.’ Amrita said the situation became worse over the course of the flight last month as the toilet and sink in the lavatory on the opposite side of the plane began to overflow as well. Passengers were forced to endure the stench for about six hours as they travelled from Delhi to London . She said she lodged a complaint on Twitter after returning to London, and the Mumbai-based airline offered an apology. She complained again and was offered a 2,000-point credit for Jet Airways’ frequent flyer club. She wasn’t satisfied with the offer, saying: ‘Personally, I have no intention to ever fly with Jet Airways again after that experience. A spokesperson for Jet Airways told MailOnline Travel: 'Jet Airways regrets any inconvenience caused to guests on board flight 9W122 DEL - LHR dt.,Feb 15, 2015, on account of reverse drainage from the sinks on board the aircraft. 'As per our investigation, the overflow was only of water from the sink. All human waste is carried by separate system and lines which functioned normally during the flight.' Jet Airways investigated the incident and maintains the liquid leaking was coming from the sinks . Ms Jaurre said: ‘Ideally, I would like compensation from Jet Airways because I feel that their offer of frequent flyer miles isn't sufficient, given that I was already quite ill on the flight and it didn't help then having to sit in that unhygienic and filthy cabin. ‘I'm unsure if any other passengers became ill but as the liquid continued to overflow and the smell became more evident, it gave me a very bad headache and made me nauseous which put me off my in-flight meal.’ She added: ‘I became quite ill after the flight with a combination of throat infection, ear infection and stomach pains and had to take a week off from work to get better. Whether these were a direct result of the situation on-board, I cannot say but it definitely didn't help.’ She is seeking monetary compensation plus a refund to cover the cost of the ticket. ‘Nobody should ever have to sit through such disgusting in-flight conditions and the right checks should have been made to the aircraft to ensure things like this shouldn't have happened.’", "answer": ["Passengers, including infant children, endured the pungent smell for hours .\nAmrita Jaurre snapped photos as water flowed into the aisles and rows .\nCabin crew tried to contain the mess by piling newspapers on the floor .\nPassengers used articles of clothing to try to mask the foul odour .\nMs Jaurre, 27, said she suffered a headache and became nauseous ."], "label": "SUM"}

Referee: Szymon Marciniak (Poland) And in the second half De Bruyne, formerly of Chelsea, stole the show, finding the net from a neat cut-back and then an excellent free kick, although both goals owed much to the poor goalkeeping of Juan Pablo Carrizo. The Belgian's first goal came after Vierinha had seized on a poor clearance from the Inter keeper, surged into the box, and crossed perfectly for De Bruyne to slide home. Then, with 15 minutes to go, the former Chelsea forward's free kick snuck past Carrizo, despite it being aimed at the side of the goal he was meant to be covering. De Bruyne could easily have completed a hat-trick, but he shot wide when through on goal in the closing stages, with only Carrizo to beat. Wolfsburg showed that they could continue their good form without goals from Europe's hottest striker at the moment, Bas Dost. The Dutchman was well below his best before he was replaced midway through the second half by Niklas Bendtner, but De Bruyne took up the slack. Inter, meanwhile, under former Manchester City boss Roberto Mancini, were poor for large periods of the game, offering little going forward, and unable to keep up the defensive solidity they had shown in the first half once they began to tire in the second 45.

{"question": "Three retired carers are accused of running a child sex ring for 30 years at a school for vulnerable children where 'abuse was almost the norm', a court has heard. Colwyn Baker, David Hennessy and Nigel Putman are said to have preyed on youngsters at the now defunct Swaylands School in Penshurst, Kent, between 1963 and 1993. As well as the abuse allegedly committed by the trio, jurors were also told Baker allegedly encouraged the boys to commit sex acts on other children. David Hennessey (pictured left) and Nigel Putman (right) are accused alongside Colwyn Baker of sexually abusing youngsters at the now-defunct Swaylands School in Penshurst, Kent, between 1963 and 1993 . The three men face a total of 49 charges against 24 victims, who were aged between 10 to 15 at the time. Baker, 71, of Morningside, Edinburgh, faces 24 counts of indecent assault and three charges of rape. Hennessy, 74, of  King's Lynn, Norfolk, has been charged with 17 counts of indecent assault, one of gross indecency with a child and one of rape. Putman, 62, of  Slough, Berkshire, faces three charges of indecent assault. They deny all of the charges against them. The men were residential child care officers at Swaylands School, which catered for boys with emotional and behavioural difficulties and which closed in 1993. They are accused of making nightly rounds and encouraging the pupils to abuse each other in a number of cruel and sometimes painful sexual 'games' - keeping them quiet with blackmail and presents. The men were residential child care officers at Swaylands School (pictured) which catered for boys with emotional and behavioural difficulties. The school closed in 1993 and has since been converted in to flats . The court heard detailed descriptions of multiple counts of alleged sexual abuse, including a sex 'game' called 'toothpaste testicles'. Opening the 12-week trial at Maidstone Crown Court today, prosecutor Philip Bennetts QC told the jury: 'The atmosphere at the school at the time that you are considering was one where abuse was almost the norm. 'Children who were abused were positively encouraged to abuse other pupils. 'Abuse and the age of pupils abused led some pupils to consider that there was nothing wrong with abusing other pupils.' One of Baker's alleged victims became so scared that he often stayed awake at night, sleeping in stairwells to avoid Baker, Mr Bennetts said. As a result, the boy would often fall asleep in class, causing a dramatic decline in his learning. He would end up being caned by the headmaster as punishment for dozing off. The court heard another boy said Baker would wake him in the middle of the night and abuse him almost nightly for three years. Another told investigators that Baker was in charge of the Scouts, karate and swimming, adding: 'Anything good that you wanted to do as a boy, Baker was in charge of it.' Baker allegedly told the boy that he had a small penis because he did not 'exercise it' enough with other boys. Mr Bennett said the boy resisted for a long time but Baker made sure no one spoke to him, until he eventually 'caved in' and allowed others to 'do it'. Hennessy allegedly abused one boy on his first or second night at Swaylands, and told his victim: 'It's not worth crying, it won't help you,' jurors heard. The 12-week trial into historic child sex abuse at the school is being held at Maidstone Crown Court (pictured) The boy told police that Hennessy abused him from the age of 10 until he was 13 or 14, when he stopped as new boys came in and he was 'getting too old'. Victims said they were targeted when they were at their 'weakest', while going to sleep, jurors heard. Mr Bennetts said one boy revealed that Baker's most effective 'blackmail' tool was not allowing him to go home at the weekend. Mr Bennetts said one boy was abused for three years on a nightly basis by Hennessy while he was at the junior school. When the boy moved to the senior school, his care worker was Baker who allegedly continued sexually abused him until he was 16. Putman was said to have tried to molest one boy while he was in the shower. When the boy told Putman to back off, he put his arms round the boy 'like a lover', Mr Bennetts said. Mr Bennetts told the court that one victim, aged around seven or eight, remembers Hennessy buying him presents to keep quiet, including an orange Donald Duck hat and ski goggles. One victim said after Baker sexually abused him for the first time he felt 'confused and upset'. Mr Bennetts said: 'The victim quickly realised he would only be allowed to watch TV and do nice things that boys wanted to do, in return for sexual acts. Mr Bennetts told the jury that Baker was convicted in 1994 of four counts of indecent assault on a boy aged under 16 and one count of gross indecency. He also disclosed that Hennessy was convicted in December 1993 of four counts of indecent assault on a boy and two sex offences against a pupil.

Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo . 9. Conakrey, Guinea . 10.Nouakchott, Mauritania . Among the top ranked cities for quality of life is beautiful Zurich, Switzerland, which came in second . The study finds that Western Europe continues to offer a stable working environment for those who relocate there, accounting for seven of the top 10 cities listed. Vienna, ranked first both in Europe and worldwide, takes top honours, but Zurich, Munich, Dusseldorf and Frankfurt all offer workers the chance for equally happy, full lives. Cities in Central and Eastern Europe, however, have a wider range of quality-of-living standards. Among the highest ranking cities? Prague, Budapest and Ljubljana in Slovenia. The region's lower ranking cities include Tirana, Minsk and Kiev, which has experienced a considerable drop following political instability and violence in Ukraine. Of the top 10 most livable cities, Germany is home to three: Munich (pictured), Dusseldorf, and Frankfurt . In the UK, London is the highest-ranked city, followed by Birmingham and Glasgow. 1. London . 2. Birmingham . 3. Glasgow . 4. Aberdeen . 5. Belfast . 'UK cities overall enjoy high standards of quality of living and remain stable and attractive locations for businesses,' another Principal at Mercer explains. In North America, Canada and the United States offer plenty of attractive relocation options, with Vancouver rounding out the top five worldwide. Headed to the United States? Consider San Francisco, Boston and Honolulu when deciding where to settle, as all are ranked among Mercer's top 50 cities worldwide. Vancouver, Canada, was the only city in North America to make the top 10 . 1. Vienna . 2. Zurich . 3. Munich . 4. Dusseldorf . 5. Frankfurt . 6. Geneva . 7. Copenhagen . 8. Amsterdam . 9. Bern . 10. Berlin . In the Pacific, New Zealand and Australian cities are some of the highest ranked, with Auckland the only entry from the region to make it to the top five. Sydney does round out the top 10 and Wellington is close behind in 12th place. But when it comes to the Middle East and Africa, Dubai is the highest ranked in the 74th spot. Emerging city Durban in South Africa is also ranked quite highly, mainly due to its high-quality housing, recreational offerings and readily available consumer goods. Baghdad is the lowest-ranking city in the region and in the survey, overall. Auckland in New Zealand ranked third for quality of life, according to the survey from Mercer . Auckland's bustling city, situated in the middle of lush greenery, offers outdoor lovers the ultimate mix . Baghdad was the lowest ranked city both in the Middle East and Africa region and also globally . Mercer's annual Quality of Living survey is conducted to help multinational companies and other employers compensate employees fairly when assigning them to international destinations. Admittedly, the survey focuses most on established and emerging business-focused cities and those with financial centres. 'Taking a short or long-term work assignment to a new country is both an exciting and challenge experience for employees and their families,' says Slagin Parakatil, Principal at Mercer. 'Cultures, societies and comparatively different climates, as well as political instability, high crime rates and poor infrastructure can be difficult to navigate and settle down in. 'Employers need to assess whether their staff and families will encounter any drop in quality of living and ensure they are fairly compensated for it.'", "answer": ["Mercer's 2015 survey found Vienna, Austria to be the most livable city .\nZurich, Auckland, Munich and Vancouver round out the top five .\nQuality of Living rankings help companies moving employees abroad ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "Williams driver Valtteri Bottas has been warned by the FIA he must stop driving the moment he suffers a repeat of the back pain that forced him out of the Australian Grand Prix. Bottas sustained a very small tear in the annular part of a disc in his lower back during qualifying, leading to severe pain. Although the Finn made himself available to drive on Sunday morning ahead of the race, the FIA ultimately declared him unfit. Valtteri Bottas briefs the press about his injury at the Sepang Circuit Medical Centre on Thursday . Bottas declared himself fit for Melbourne after suffering a back injury in qualifying, but still missed the race . Ahead of Sunday's race in Malaysia, Bottas has now been given the all clear, albeit with the proviso from the FIA that 'in case of a recurrence of pain, or any abnormal feeling, he must stop at the earliest opportunity'. Bottas has no doubt he will come through unscathed as he said: 'The back is good, no pain, which is nice. 'At the end of last week I could do something without any pain, and during the weekend I could swim, cross-train without any pain, so the recovery was really good. 'We've done everything we can in this short period of time - luckily there are two weeks - so I feel confident of getting back in the car.' Bottas has revealed the injury was due to his brake and seat position inside his car, which have since been corrected. 'The back is now in a more neutral position, less pressure on the discs. We are confident that should be it,' added Bottas. Preparations are ramping up in Kuala Lumpur ahead of the Malaysian Grand Prix . Mercedes director Toto Wolff (right) speaks with Bottas in the paddock in Kuala Lumpur . 'I've never had any problems before with the lower back. That kind of thing normally takes a bit of time to build up. 'But there was no warning, it went suddenly under maximum braking. It was like someone putting a knife in there, with the pain ramping up through to midnight. 'During the night it started to ease off. In the morning I would have been ready to race. 'I did pass the tests, but the FIA had access to all the material from the hospital, from the MRI and that stuff. 'Maybe they thought it was better (not to race) in the longer term, which could have been true. 'It was very disappointing, but I also respect the FIA's decision, with the support great from the team.' As a precaution, Williams on Thursday announced Adrian Sutil as their reserve driver, with the German back in Formula One after being axed by Sauber at the end of last year. Although Susie Wolff is test driver and young Briton Alex Lynn the development driver, Williams believe experience is crucial should a sudden change be required. Sir Frank Williams said: 'The fight for a top constructors' championship position will be intense this season. 'Therefore we have selected a driver with recent race experience and are confident if the need arose, he would be a solid pair of hands to race the FW37 and assist our 2015 campaign.'", "answer": ["Valtteri Bottas suffered tear in a disc in his lower back in Melbourne .\nInjury caused pain 'like a knife' would, forcing him out of Australian GP .\nWilliams driver insists he is fine to race in Malaysian GP .\nBut he has been warned he must withdraw if he feels more pain ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "India took apart a diligent but limited Ireland attack to sweep to an untroubled eight-wicket victory at Seddon Park on Tuesday which confirmed they will top Pool B in the cricket World Cup. After dismissing Ireland for 249 with an over to spare when their spinners established a stranglehold on the top-order batting, Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan played themselves in for a token couple of overs. They then launched a full-blooded attack, alternating flowing drives with explosive pulls while also pushing around the ball for comfortable singles.

Virat Kohli is congratulated by captain MS Dhoni after steering India to an eight-wicket victory . Ireland's Stuart Thompson celebrates after bowling Rohit Sharma for 64 runs . Sharma knocks the ball away for a single during India's run chase in Hamilton . Dhawan was dropped on five when John Mooney failed to hold a fierce caught-and-bowled chance. After scoring five further runs he was dropped again off the unlucky Mooney, this time at backward point when captain William Porterfield parried a stinging cut but was unable to hang on to the rebound. Those were the only times the Irish bowlers looked like taking a wicket and the duo took the score to 174 when Sharma chopped medium pacer Stuart Thompson on to his stumps and was out for 64 from 66 balls. With the Indian supporters making a tremendous din, Dhawan took a single to complete his eighth one-day century from 84 balls with five sixes but was then caught off the following ball he faced from Thompson. Virat Kohli (44 not out) and Ajinkya Rahane (33 not out) took their team to victory with 13.1 overs to spare. Porterfield elected to bat on a warm afternoon before a capacity crowd of 11,000 packed into a picturesque ground in New Zealand's fourth largest city and all seemed set fair for the Irish when the captain and Paul Stirling put on 89 for the first wicket from 15 overs. Mahendra Singh Dhoni turned to his spinners and Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja and Suresh Raina responded by first frustrating then dismissing the Irish batsmen who found boundaries hard to come by after the initial flurry. Stirling (42) lofted a simple catch to long-off off Ashwin's bowling and Ed Joyce was bowled for two trying to cut a ball from Raina which was too full for the shot.

Niall O'Brien was the top scorer with 75 including three sixes, one of which was helped over the boundary rope by Mohammed Shami leaping high to try to take the catch. O'Brien, swinging vigorously to the leg side, kept the scoreboard moving but wickets fell regularly at the other end, including that of the dangerous Kevin O'Brien who was caught behind for one from a thin edge off Shami.

Rosie-Ann Stone has married Private Liam Fisher, who risked his own life trying to save her fatally injured brother in Afghanistan . But he could not be saved, and the young soldier died of his wounds at the scene. His sister Rosie-Ann Stone, of Atwick, near Hornsea, East Yorkshire, heard of Pte Fisher's bravery at her brother's inquest and the couple stayed in touch by exchanging Facebook messages.

'Things that were important aren't important anymore. 'It kind of makes life a lot easier I think, just because there's just one thing that's kind of all you think about. It definitely simplifies stuff.' When Johnson announced his decision to step away from golf last July due to 'personal challenges', rumors about his lifestyle swirled, including the suggestion that he may have been suspended by the PGA Tour. Indeed, Golf.com reported that Johnson had failed three drug tests: one for marijuana in 2009 and two for cocaine, in 2012 and 2014.

And in a news conference on Sunday when if he had ever failed a Tour drugs test, Johnson replied: 'No. Thanks'. In a candid interview with Sports Illustrated this January, Johnson revealed that alcohol was his real vice. He said he would excessively drink and party to relieve stress, with his tipple of choice being Grey Goose, soda and lime.

{"question": "Depraved mothers who gave up their lives in the West to live under the rule of Islamic State terrorists in Syria are taking photographs of their newborn children sleeping alongside handguns and assault rifles in a sickening game of one-upmanship on social media. Featuring titles such as 'The Little Terrorist' and 'Generation Kilafah', the chilling images show innocent children being forced to embrace their parents' extremism in ISIS' de facto capital Raqqa. While some shots feature children so young that they are unlikely to be aware of the significance of the photographs, another shows a masked young girl of around three-years-old dressed in full combat gear, carrying an AK47 and raising her index figure to make a well-known jihadi gesture. 'The Little Terrorist': A newborn baby is seen sleeping under a Hello Kitty blanket. The otherwise adorable photograph is ruined by the fact an AK47 machine gun is propped up against the side of the tiny baby's bed . Exploited: A masked young girl of around three-years-old is seen dressed in full combat gear, carrying an AK47 assault rifle, and raising her index figure to make a well-known jihadi gesture . Although the images were posted on Twitter over the past year, they form part of a new study of the everyday lives and, inevitably, deaths of the young Western women who chose to live under ISIS. One photograph in the study, which was published on Buzzfeed, shows a woman calling herself Umm Abdullatif posting a photograph of a young boy aged about five dressed in military fatigues and firing a huge assault rifle. She identifies the child as her son's 'lil best mate' and suggests he has already been killed, adding that she hope her own child 'grows up to be like him and receives and beautiful death just like him'. Another photograph, this time posted by a woman calling herself Umm Usama, shows a one-year-old girl sleeping alongside a small, black pistol and is captioned 'Even my baby girl goes 2 bed with her gun #generationkhilafah'. A similar image was posted on Twitter showing a newborn baby fast asleep in a plastic crate and covered in a Hello Kitty blanket. The otherwise adorable photograph is ruined, however, by the fact an AK47 machine gun is propped up against the side of the tiny baby's bed. The image was posted on Twitter by a man claiming to be the child's father and was captioned: 'The Little Terrorist #Hammam was born in the land of the caliphate, I ask God Almighty to make him one of the Caliphate’s soldiers.' Horror: Featuring titles such as 'The Little Terrorist' and 'Generation Kilafah', the chilling images show innocent children being forced to embrace their parents' extremism in ISIS' de facto capital Raqqa .

She identifies him as her son's 'lil best mate', suggests he has already been killed, and adds that she hope her own child 'grows up to be like him and receives and beautiful death just like him' The study reveals numerous other images of young children being exploited for shocking photographs that are later posted by their twisted parents on social media. The majority show young boys and girls dressed in combat clothing and brandishing weapons and are captioned with horrific messages by their parents wishing the children a hasty death. Others show young boys and girls wearing clothing daubed in the chilling black and white ISIS logo, stating that the children are being 'raised as lions' who will one day fight against the West. The overall effect is to instill fear in the West that even if the current generation of ISIS jihadis are killed, there will still be generation after generation of bloodthirsty, brainwashed terrorists ready to fight and die in order to carry out atrocities against innocent people. The use of sickening images of gun toting children also allows the often very young militant parents to brag and boast about how 'hardcore' they are, distancing themselves from Western ideals of parenthood and encouraging them to take part in a pathetic one-upmanship on social media. Sick: This photograph shows young boys whose fathers have all been killed fighting for ISIS posing in the terror group's capital city Raqqa. The woman who posted the image said that the boys' mothers  are now raising them to be the next generation of anti-Western terrorists ready to fight and die for ISIS . Two young British women posted this photograph on Twitter saying they were living in ISIS' capital city Raqqa . The study of ISIS wives was released as an Australian jihadist widow shared a series of propaganda pictures she says shows her 'five star jihad' lifestyle - and says she and other female jihadists are 'thirsty' for the blood of her former countrymen. In photographs posted to a Twitter account believed to belong to former Melbourne woman Zehra Duman, several women are pictured standing under an Islamic State flag, reclining against a clean white BMW M5, wielding machine guns and dressed from head to toe in black Islamic dress. In one tweet, Duman said: 'US + Australia, how does it feel that all 5 of us were born n raised in your lands, & now here thirsty for ur blood?' Another image of five women standing under an Islamic State flag is captioned: 'Can't mess with my clique. From the land down under, to the land of Khilafah. Thats the Aussie spirit.' Duman's account follows the similar naming conventions as previous social media accounts. It also  featured pictures of her late reported partner, the so-called 'Playboy Jihadi' Mahmoud Abdullatif, as her 'beautiful husband'. Daily Mail Australia reported in January that Duman congratulated her late partner for his death after he was reportedly killed. 'You won the race!' she tweeted, describing him as a 'green bird' - the term used to describe a so-called martyr. Life as normal: Women living under the rule of ISIS in Syria regularly post photographs of the food they are eating online and boasting that electricity in Raqqa is continuing to run . Another photograph of food posted online by ISIS militants was captioned ' Breakfast in the Islamic State' Despite the brutal treatment of men and women living under the rule of the Islamic State in Syria, thousands of Westerners have made the journey to the terrorists' de facto Syrian capital Raqqa. Yesterday it emerged that yet another young woman had fled the UK in a bid to reach ISIS. Photographed in a police cell, the 21-year-old jihadi suspect named by officials as Jaila Nadra H was arrested by Turkish security services as she waited to board a bus in Ankara. They believe the Muslim convert from East London was attempting to travel to the lawless and often porous border with Syria. The woman faces being deported back to the UK where she is likely to be arrested on suspicion of preparing acts of terrorism. Sky News reports she is being held pending deportation hearings. One official said she was expected to be deported 'soon'. Last night her family expressed shock at her arrest.  A cousin told the Daily Mail: 'She converted to Islam several years ago and we hear little from her... Her father has recently come out of hospital where he was undergoing chemotherapy. It is hard to believe this could happen.' Turkish officials said authorities apprehended the woman based on local intelligence and were not tipped off by British authorities. Five star jihad: The ISIS wives study emerged as a Twitter account understood to belong to Zehra Duman posted a series of photographs of jihadist women 'from Australia and the US' posing with a BMW M5 . Alarming: Zehra Duman posted this photograph to social media with the caption: '5 star jihad. M5 (the BMW) in the land of sham (Syria) he he ' Turkish authorities are holding a 21-year-old British woman named by officials as Jaila Nadra H (pictured) on suspicion of trying to travel to Syria and into Islamic State territory to join the terror group . The arrest comes days after three British teenagers were arrested at the airport in the Turkish city of Istanbul and thrown out of the country. The young men, two aged 17 and a third aged 19, were questioned by counter-terrorism police on their return to the UK and released on bail. They have told their families they wanted to go to Syria to 'help', and denied subscribing to the beliefs of militant Islamists. Last month three British girls – Shamima Begum, 15, Kadiza Sultana, 16, and Amira Abase, 15 – travelled to Turkey. They were following in the footsteps of a fourth girl from their school, a close friend, who travelled to Syria last December. There are increasing concerns about the growing numbers of young people being lured to the warzone in Syria and Iraq. Last week David Cameron said everyone has a responsibility to examine why people should want to join Islamic State. Turkey is an important ally to the West as European states attempt to stem the flow of foreign fighters bolstering the ranks of Islamic State. It has been criticised for allowing fighters to cross the border into Syria but in return has asked why other countries allow militants to travel in the first place.", "answer": ["Depraved terrorists use social media to share photos of gun-toting children .\nChilling images are titled 'The Little Terrorist' and 'Generation Kilafah'\nThey show young boys and girls with guns dressed in combat clothing .\nOthers show sleeping newborn babies with rifles propped against the bed .\nPhotographs are a sickening attempt for the twisted men and women living under the rule of ISIS to outdo one another on social media ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "A paleo cookbook for infants co-authored by My Kitchen Rules chef Pete Evans has been delayed over grave concerns about a recipe for baby formula made from liver and bone broth. The cookbook, Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way, has been slammed by the Public Health Association of Australia as having the potential to stunt the growth of babies and impair development. One recipe is a do-it-yourself baby formula made from liver and bone broth - one of Evans' signature Paleo creations. Scroll down for video . Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way, has been slammed by the Public Health Association of Australia as having the potential to stunt the growth of babies . 'In my view, there's a very real possibility that a baby may die if this book goes ahead,' said Professor Heather Yeatman, president of the PHAA. The cookbook is the joint venture of celebrity chef Evans, a long time advocate for the paleo diet, baby-blogger Charlotte Carr and naturopath Helen Padarin. Evans has previously released two best-selling cookbooks through publisher Pan MacMillan, including titles Family Food and Healthy Every Day, and Carr, the wife of Australian Idol contestant Wes Carr, runs the popular Bubba Yum Yum website. Bubba Yum Yum: the Paleo Way was marketed as 'simple, delicious paleo recipes for new mothers, babies and toddlers' by 'health crusaders' Carr,  Padarin and Evans, who 'have seen firsthand the positive impact a paleo way of eating has had on their families' wellbeing'. The greatest concern, especially given that none of the authors have medical qualifications, lie with the do-it-yourself baby formula, which is made primarily from liver and bone broth, reported The Australian Women's Weekly. Publisher Pan Macmillan has reportedly held off on the scheduled release date of the cookbook of March 13 . Evans posted a 2,100 word rant on social media in October last year claiming that the modern Australian diet is behind the rise in autism . Charlotte Carr (left), the wife of Australian Idol contestant Wes Carr (centre), runs the popular Bubba Yum Yum website and is a co-author of the book . The broth reportedly contains ten times the recommended daily intake of Vitamin A for infants, but lacks other basic nutrients needed for sustenance. Professor Yeatman said that while adults have the choice to follow the paleo diet, which excludes dairy and grains, parents are responsible for the diet of their children and that it would be unfair for parents to force 'unproven' beliefs on them. Evans, who is currently on a national tour promoting the paleo lifestyle, has long been a passionate advocate of the diet . 'That's the really troubling thing: the infant is totally at the whim of their parents when it comes to feeding. If the wrong decision is made, they may be seriously affected,' she said. Further concerns have been raised about the inclusion of runny eggs and added salt in the recipes, which contradicts national health guidelines. Federal Health Minister Sussan Ley has allegedly been contacted regarding the issue, and publisher Pan Macmillan has reportedly held off on the scheduled release date of the cookbook of March 13. The Federal Department of Health released a statement regarding the concerns that had been brought to its attention. 'The Department of Health is aware of this publication and has concerns about the inadequate nutritional value of some of the recipes, in particular the infant formula, and has been consulting with experts and will continue to investigate this matter,' the statement said. In July last year, the Dietitians Association of Australia (DAA) criticised the paleo diet, with the association's chief executive officer Claire Hewat labelling the Paleo diet was 'potentially dangerous' and evidence of its benefits 'just doesn't stack up'. The Paleo diet requires people to cut out 'grains, legumes, certain dairy products, conventionally-raised meats, non-organic produce, and genetically modified and processed foods', which Ms Hewart says is not practical for many Australians. A disclaimer at the back of the cookbook states that the co-authors 'in good faith' the recipes will lead to a healthier life, 'relying on the information contained in this publication may not give you the results you desire or may cause negative health consequences.' Pete Evans, pictured with fellow paleo enthusiasts Luke Hines (left), and Wes Carr, wife of fellow co-author Charlotte Carr, has been an outspoken advocate of the paleo diet . Evans has previously released two best-selling cookbooks through publisher Pan MacMillan, including titles Family Food and Healthy Every Day . Despite this, the book has been described as 'a treasure trove of nutritional information and nourishing paleo recipes that are guaranteed to put you and your little one on the path to optimum health.' Evans, who is currently on a national tour promoting the paleo lifestyle, has long been a passionate advocate of the diet, and has come under fire for some of his more controversial claims about the Australian food industry. Evans posted a 2,100 word rant on social media in October last year claiming that the modern Australian diet is behind the rise in autism, taking aim at the Heart Foundation and the Dietitians Association of Australia (DAA)  as he promoted the so-called benefits of the paleo diet. His fiery rant, which was motivated by a comment from a dietician on his Facebook page, challenged the idea of the Heart Foundation's tick and also questioned some of the beliefs held by the DAA - both of which have spoken out against the paleo diet.

{"question": "The callous owner of this tiny Rottweiler puppy threw her out with the rubbish after severe spinal damage left her unable to stand. Vets made the difficult decision to put the stricken three-month-old animal to sleep due to the serious nature of her injuries. The puppy was found curled up in a cardboard box and dumped next to some bins in Enfield, north London. Vets were forced to put down this dumped three-month-old Rottweiler puppy after it was unable to stand due to severe spinal damage . A second newborn Rottweiler cross, believed to be from the same litter, was found nearby and showed signs of mistreatment. Anna White, manager at the RSPCA's Southridge Animal Centre, in Potters Bar, Hertfordshire, described it as one of the saddest cases she has seen. 'This poor puppy was brought to us in the cardboard box she was found in, and could not stand up, let alone walk, and definitely could not get out of the box,' she said. 'Her back legs were just not working properly and she was very, very poorly. And yet she was just left like this, on her own, on a busy London street in the freezing cold. 'She was tossed out, when she was at her most vulnerable. It is just heartbreaking.' X-rays revealed the dog had extensive spinal damage but vets were unable to ascertain whether it was due to the abuse or a birth defect. RSPCA inspector Kate Ford said: 'We do not know how this poor dog came to be dumped in this way and can't be sure whether her health issues were something she was born with or were the result of some mistreatment. 'She was of a very distinct silver-hued colouring, and there have also been reports of other puppies in the area of North London with similar colouring, also being mistreated, so the concern is that there could be others out there in need of help. The eight puppies could have died after being dumped in a rubbish bin in Queenferry, North Wales . Eight tiny newborn puppies found in a rubbish bin were at the centre of an RSPCA investigation. The tiny pups - some with their umbilical cords still attached - were discovered by a group of a children in Queensferry, North Wales. Bosses from the animal charity said they were stunned at how someone could throw away the animals as if they were rubbish. As well as praising the quick-thinking actions of the youngsters who contacted a local dog warden after yesterday's shocking discovery in Chester Road East, officials also urged anyone with information to come forward. RSPCA inspector Tim Jones said: 'It is totally unnecessary and these puppies could have died if nobody had heard them. They could not be seen in the bin. 'They all appeared to be fine but are very young as some of them had their umbilical cords still attached.' 'We are appealing for information to try and find out who abandoned these tiny dogs.' The puppies - thought to be Staffordshire bull terrier cross-breeds - are now being cared for the RSPCA.

{"question": "A family are furious after staff refused to allow their soya and dairy intolerant toddler to eat his special packed lunch in the restaurant. Alex and Coral Pouros had spent £30 on the day out to Wingham Wildlife Park with 20 month-old Elliot. They had prepared a special meal for the youngster who is restricted on what he can eat because of an intolerance to dairy and soya, and planned to buy food for themselves from the zoo restaurant. Alex and Coral Pouros (pictured with their son) had spent £30 on the day out to Wingham Wildlife Park with 20 month-old Elliot . But they were furious when park owner Tony Binskin insisted they could not eat in the restaurant and offered them a nearby empty room instead. The family refused and left the zoo near Canterbury, Kent after just two hours and vowed never to return. Osteopath Alex, 32, said: 'We explained the situation and as it was very cold outside I thought he would be understanding. 'I even said that if they had any dairy or soya-free food, we would buy that for Elliott. 'They didn't, but he still insisted he could not eat his lunch in the restaurant. The couple had prepared a special meal for the youngster who is restricted on what he can eat because of an intolerance to lactose and soya . The couple had planned to buy their own lunch at Wingham Wildlife Park's restaurant (pictured) 'To be honest, we were pretty upset because it seemed totally unreasonable. It's not as if the place was packed because there were plenty of places to sit. 'I wasn't prepared for Elliott to have to eat his lunch outside in the cold and told the owner that we had two choices - either we were allowed to sit indoors or we would have to leave. 'But he wouldn't budge so we left after spending £30 to get in and having a visit that lasted just a couple of hours.' Alex, of Broadstairs, Kent, added: 'It was actually Coral's 32nd birthday and we thought it would be a nice day out, but sadly it wasn't. 'We had been to the park before with a young niece and enjoyed the experience but this time we just felt angry and hurt and certainly won't be going back.' Markus Wilder, curator of the animal collection, disputed the family's claim there was no options for their son at the cafe. 'We have a menu of 55 items and there are only ten of them that contain soya or dairy,' he said. 'Any of our cooked meals he would have been fine to eat; we have jacket potatoes, burgers...' But the family were furious when park owner Tony Binskin insisted they could not eat in the restaurant and offered them a nearby empty room instead . The family left the zoo near Canterbury, Kent after just two hours and have since vowed never to return . Mr Wilder said the family had been asked to leave the restaurant due to the park's strict policy but claimed they had been offered their own private room instead. 'We're only a fairly small park, and we have fairly limited seating so we have a policy that you cannot eat outside food from outside in the restaurant. It applies across the board. 'The trouble is if we let one person have a packed lunch, then others see it and start to ask why they have been refused. 'It just gets very awkward for us because many people and children have special dietary requirements these days. 'In this case, I spoke to the family and did offer them an empty room nearby where they could still eat indoors, but the mother, in particular, still wasn't happy. 'We also have covered areas outside for people who bring their own food.

{"question": "Death Row: Kelly Gissendaner (pictured) is set to die by lethal injection in Georgia at 7pm tonight . The only woman in Georgia on death row is due to be executed tonight at 7pm - after an astonishing last meal of cheeseburgers, fries, ice cream and a fatty salad - unless lawyers can convince officials to spare her life. Kelly Renee Gissendaner, 46, is due to be given a lethal injection at a state prison in Jackson in retribution for plotting the murder of her husband in 1997. She was sentenced to die after her boyfriend, Gregory Owen, stabbed Douglas Gissendaner to death at her urging. Gissendaner, who will be the first female executed in Georgia in 70 years, has also made headlines with her request from prison authorities for a no-holds-barred last meal. The feast includes two Burger King Whoppers, two large orders of fries, cornbread, a salad drenched in buttermilk dressing, popcorn and cherry-vanilla ice cream. However, there is a chance she receive a last-minute stay of execution - if her lawyers convince Georgia's justice system to cancel the killing. Attorneys are mounting a last-ditch attempt to persuade the State Board of Pardons and Paroles to commute her sentence to life without parole. She was denied clemency at a hearing last week, but lawyers argue that extra witnesses from within the prison system could help persuade them. Previous attempts have rested on her remorse and new-found faith. In a statement ten years ago, Gissendaner herself said: 'I deserve to be here, but I don't deserve to die'. Murder: Gissendaner, shown left in her arrest mugshot from 1997, is facing death for plotting the murder of her husband. However, her boyfriend Gregory Owen, right, who actually did the deed, is not on death row and could be paroled within a decade . Monster meal: Gissendaner, pictured above with a regular prison meal, requested an enormous spread including two cheeseburger meals, cornbread, ice cream, and popcorn for her last meal . She has also drawn attention to the fact that, while she did not kill her husband, the man who struck the fatal blows is not facing death - and will be eligible for parole in 2023. If the bid fails, her lawyers are expected to ask the Supreme Court to intervene. It has already denied one appeal. Her execution had been due to take place last week, but was canceled after a winter storm caused disruption in the area. Gissendaner would be the first woman executed in Georgia since 1945 and only the 16th woman put to death nationwide since the Supreme Court allowed the death penalty to resume in 1976. Gissendaner's lawyers note that the parole board already heard from many people testifying about her faith and remorse at a hearing last week before denying her clemency. But, her lawyers argue, the board did not hear from many Department of Corrections employees whose perspective 'would have left no doubt that a grant of clemency is supported in this case.' The most important witness the board did not hear from is Kathy Seabolt, who served as her warden for six years, first at Metro State Prison and then at Lee Arrendale State Prison. Locked away: Gissendaner, pictured above in 2004, has been locked up for the past 17 years . Seabolt could testify that former parole board chair James Donald promised Gissendaner would receive clemency, her lawyers wrote. Each time the topic came up in conversations between Donald and Seabolt, 'Donald reiterated his statement that Ms. Gissendaner did not need to worry about clemency as it was a foregone conclusion,' they wrote. Gissendaner's lawyers also urged the parole board to subpoena some other corrections employees so they can testify without fear of retaliation. Although department rules allow employees to speak to lawyers for capital clemency proceedings, the reality is less clear, Gissendaner's lawyers wrote. Some employees had said they would testify and provide written statements on Gissendaner's behalf, but changed their minds after getting a memo from the new warden, who succeeded Seabolt last year. 'Under no circumstances are you to discuss this with people outside the institution. Staff should also be careful what is said to other inmates and personal feelings are to be suppressed,' Kathleen Kennedy wrote on Jan. 29 as she notified staff of the likelihood of the upcoming execution. Gissendaner's lawyers also urged the board to consider that before trial, she had been offered the same plea deal as Owen - life in prison with an agreement not to seek parole for 25 years. 'At one time, therefore, all the parties involved in the case thought a sentence less than death was appropriate for Ms. Gissendaner,' her lawyers wrote. Owen, who is the one who stabbed Douglas Gissendaner to death, took the deal and testified for the prosecution. Gissendaner balked at the parole agreement and took her lawyer's advice to go to trial. The parole board has granted clemency before in cases involving disproportionate sentences for co-defendants, her lawyers wrote. 'In fact, this Board has on at least four occasions in the past commuted a death sentence of a co-defendant who was not the actual killer of the victim,' the lawyers wrote. Douglas Gissendaner's parents and sisters want her to be executed, but two of Kelly and Douglas' three children have asked the parole board to spare her life, the lawyers wrote. In statements submitted with her clemency application, Kayla and Dakota Gissendaner describe a journey from bitterness and anger to forgiveness; finally they have a meaningful relationship with their mother. 'We also believe that Kelly's death will not restore them or make them whole,' Gissendaner's lawyers wrote of the entire Gissendaner family.", "answer": ["Kelly Renee Gissendaner, 46, to receive lethal injection in Jackson at 7pm .\nShe plotted the 1997 murder of her husband with her boyfriend .\nChose cheeseburgers, fries, cornbread, ice cream, buttermilk-dressed salad, lemonade and popcorn for last meal .\nGissendaner's lawyers are begging Georgia authorities for stop her death .\nHave claimed that she has found God in prison and is reformed .\nGeorgia has not executed a woman since 1946 ."], "label": "SUM"}

A teenager who grinned for his mugshot after staggering drunk out of a family wedding to carry out a 'terrifying' crime spree involving burglary and sexual assault has been jailed for five and a half years. Connor King, 18, went on a rampage after the reception, breaking into a flat in Folkestone, Kent, where two women and a baby were sleeping. He woke the women and demanded alcohol but when they refused he threatened to kill them and they had to lock themselves in a bedroom. King then went into a second bedroom and attacked a man while he was sleeping, punching him in the head up to 30 times before sexually assaulting him.

{"question": "They are known as some of nature's most reclusive predators, and it seems this owl was keen to live up to that reputation when it was spotted by a photographer in a park in the Czech Republic. Peeking out from behind a tree, the huge bird of prey appeared to play hide and seek with senior engineer and photographer Jiri Michal as he tried to capture it on film. The amusing game of peek-a-boo took place in Vysoka, a small village in the country's hilly east, while the seven-year-old male owl was out hunting. Surprise: A great grey owl pokes it head out from behind a tree as Jiri Michal, 34, a senior engineer and photographer, captures the bird of prey on film . Playing games: Mr Michal, who spent three hours trying to photograph owls before spotting this one, said he wasn't sure what the bird was doing, but it appeared to be playing a game with him . Mr Michal, 34, of Pilsen, Czech Republic, said: 'I wasn't sure what this mischievous owl was doing, however it kept poking its head out from behind this tree as if it was playing a game with me. 'Owls are definitely my favourite birds. They have amazing eyes and are always pleasure to photograph.' Mr Michal said he had been photographing the birds for three hours when he spotted this one roughly 20ft away. He added: 'This owl was not in the mood to play for too long, and straight after I took these pictures he flew off. 'I'm forever thinking up new ideas for what to photograph and I love nature as a whole. From the smallest insects to the larger birds and mammals, they must all be protected.' The great grey owl is the largest species of owl, measuring up to two and a half feet in length, and lives in northern America, Canada, and northern Europe. Despite owl's reputation as night hunters, great grey owls often seek out prey during the day, perching high in branches and using their excellent hearing and eyesight to track down prey. Now you see me: The great grey owl is the largest species of owl, measuring up to two and a half feet in length. Despite the animal's reputation for being nocturnal, this species often hunts during the day . Youngster: Mr Michal believes the owl was a male, and was around seven years old, making it relatively young. Captive birds have been known to live up to 27 years old . Their large face, and two disc-shaped plumes of feathers around their eyes, act as satellite dishes, filtering sound into two highly sensitive ears under the feathers. Their hearing is so acute that, during the winter months, the owls often hunt by swooping low over snow drifts, listening for the sound of voles or gophers moving around underneath. Their large, soft feathers and slow, deep wingbeats mean they are nearly silent as they move, so as not to scare their prey away. Once they have locked on to a target underneath the snow, they will use their sharp talons to plunge through the ice and drag their meal out. While the birds are not migratory, they will roam for miles around their usual hunting grounds if prey becomes scarce.", "answer": ["Jiri Michal, 34, spotted owl while walking in park in west Czech Republic .\nAnimal seemed to be playing game with him while hopping around a tree .\nGreat grey owls can reach more than two feet long and hunt in daylight ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "Johnny Herbert believes McLaren could find themselves at the back end of the grid when the new Formula One season gets under way. The Woking-based marque have struggled to put in the pre-season testing miles due to a number of issues with their new car - with Honda returning to the sport and providing their first attempt at a current F1 power unit.

'The middle pack is tight but we haven't seen the McLaren setting their best times so we don't know where they will be. 'The run of over 100 laps (from Button in Barcelona) put them in the middle of that pack - is that a true showing of their pace? We really don't know. 'We don't know the whole grid order because I don't think everyone has shown their full hand and, unfortunately for McLaren and everyone else, I don't think Mercedes have either.' With the news that Alonso, re-signed to the team after the Spaniard left Ferrari, will be sitting out of the curtain-raiser after his mysterious crash has only added to McLaren's issues - with Herbert questioning why the rekindled relationship with Honda has got off to such an underwhelming start. 'McLaren have been a disappointment so far,' the former Benetton and Stewart driver told the Press Association. Fernando Alonso will miss the curtain-raiser in Australia after his horrific crash in Barcelona . 'You were thinking \"Honda have come back and are back with McLaren again. They had all the success in the late 80s and they had last year to look and see what was going on - they saw other manufacturers having to overcome issues whilst they were working on their engine. 'All of these issues they have had have made it really difficult for them to get any serious running whatsoever. They have had a mass of problems that haven't helped them. 'It is sad news that Fernando will not be in Australia - everything has gone against them so far. 'The preparation is something that maybe wasn't to the high standards than Ron Dennis is always after. 'This is something that should have been ready, the new Honda relationship and moving it forward with Jenson and Fernando. 'If it all comes together they might get a good result but it is going to be hard in the opening couple of races - the hardest of their careers.'", "answer": ["Johnny Herbert believes McLaren could find themselves at the back end of the grid when the F1 season starts .\nMcLaren have often found their car back in the garage with one fault or another .\nFernando Alonso will miss the season opener in Australia ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "(CNN)As expected, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave a rousing speech to Congress, rich in historic imagery and replete with literary references. Yet a speech filled with powerful words is no substitute for a strategy for actually preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. As national security adviser Susan Rice told the pro-Israel lobbying group AIPAC on Monday, \"Precisely because this is such a serious issue, we must weigh the different options before us and choose the best one. Sound bites won't stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.\" The Obama administration, on the other hand, is making a strong and credible case that the deal it is pursuing would block Iran's pathways to developing the fissile material necessary for a bomb and extend the time for Iran to produce enough weapons-grade uranium to build a bomb from today's estimated three months to at least a year. Without a deal, Iran would revert to building up its stockpile of nuclear uranium, while the international community would lose the ability to monitor and track Iran's activities. At the top of the list of questions the Prime Minister failed to address is how such a scenario in the wake of \"no deal\" would actually make Israel safer? As Rice said: \"Here's what's likely to happen without a deal. Iran will install and operate advanced centrifuges. Iran will seek to fuel its (plutonium) reactor in Arak. Iran will rebuild its uranium stockpile.  And, we'll lose the unprecedented inspections and transparency we have today.\" If no deal that the United States and five other powers actually might strike with the Iranians would be acceptable to Netanyahu, how does he propose to deal with the Iranian nuclear threat? He spoke about ratcheting up international sanctions against Iran and keeping them in place until Iran ceased regional aggression, sponsorship of terrorism and threatens to annihilate Israel. But years of extraordinarily tough sanctions did not persuade the Iranians to abandon their nuclear program or prevent them moving it forward. Neither did cyberwarfare or a series of assassinations of Iranian scientists. And if the United States was seen as walking away from a possible agreement, the international sanctions regime would likely crumble, not strengthen. Iranian hard-liners who oppose an agreement would be back in the driver's seat in Tehran, while those would want to see Iran rejoin the international community would be discredited and sidelined. It is doubtful that Netanyahu really believes sanctions would end the Iranian nuclear program. That leaves one other option -- military force. Of course, Israel could order a military strike on Iran any time it chooses, but Israel's ability to inflict significant damage on Iran's widely dispersed and heavily defended nuclear facilities is limited. When the discussion turns to military action, what is really meant is U.S. military action. It is understandable that a foreign leader speaking in the U.S. Congress would shy away from openly asking Washington to attack another country, especially after the experience of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which Netanyahu also lobbied for. We should recall Netanyahu's September 2002 testimony to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, six months before the U.S. assault on Baghdad began, when he said: \"It's not a question of whether Iraq's regime should be taken out but when should it be taken out; it's not a question of whether you'd like to see a regime change in Iran but how to achieve it.\" Netanyahu may have learned from that experience. He knows that the U.S. public is weary of war and has no appetite for another military adventure in the Middle East. That's why he advocates policies that would put the United States on a path to military action without mentioning the words \"military action.\" This Israeli leader, who faces a tough election back home in two weeks, has mastered the art of policy vagueness. He applied the same strategy to the failed negotiations with the Palestinians last year, declaring he was in favor of a two-state solution but never putting forward a detailed proposal for where the border should be drawn -- or on any other substantive issue for that matter. His biggest demand once again was rhetorical -- that the Palestinians recognize Israel as a Jewish state. This is an Israeli leader who believes in the power of words -- especially his words. But words are no substitute for a strategy -- and that's where Netanyahu once again failed himself, his country and his audience.", "answer": ["Jeremy Ben-Ami: Netanyahu's powerfully worded speech is no substitute for a strategy to keep Iran from getting nuclear weapons .\nHe says without a plan, the only option is to put U.S. on path to military action .\nNetanyahu also lobbied for Iraq invasion in 2002, Ben-Ami says ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "The League Cup remains Celtic’s Achilles heel. The Scottish trophy which has eluded them most often. Since beating Saturday's opponents Dundee United in the 1997-98 final, the Parkhead club have won it a further four times. To supporters of smaller, provincial clubs, that would be a form of nirvana. A glorious period of outstanding achievement. Ronny Deila is determined to get his hands on the League Cup after Sunday's final against Dundee United . To Celtic, it’s a source of mild failure. In the same period the club has captured twice as many league titles. And six Scottish Cups The clubs previous two managers, Tony Mowbray and Neil Lennon, didn’t win the League Cup at all and Lennon’s record in cups was a source of occasional unrest. For Ronny Deila, then, the first trophy of his Celtic tenure would be hugely significant. ‘It is something we would remember for the rest of our lives,’ said the Norwegian. ‘Cup finals are big. They are big in Norway and in Scotland and England. This tradition is important.’ Bold and forthright, Deila has publicly pledged to win a Treble. Managers usually play down talk of clean sweeps and banish the very words from their vocabulary. A fatalistic, superstitious streak runs through Scottish football, but Deila isn’t having it. Far from piling pressure on himself or his players, he believes it sets a target to strive for. Celtic expect to win all three domestic trophies every season. Saying so should be no cause for palpitations. ‘I am very calm,’ said Deila with a grin. ‘Maybe too much. Hopefully it will come on Sunday - but we have so many big matches you get used to it. ‘If this had been a small club, the cup final would be totally crazy. It would be all: “Who is going to sit here and what are we going to do with the supporters?” But this club has done it so many times, so it’s very calm. ‘We just prepare for what’s ahead of us and I think we can feel in the atmosphere of the players there is a big game coming up. Again, we can reach one of our targets and that’s important.’ Deila issues instructions to his players during the recent Scottish Cup quarter-final draw with Dundee United . In one sense he is correct. Celtic have been in many cup finals, too many to mention. But he hasn’t. ‘In 2010, Stromsgodset beat a First Division team in the final,’ he recalled. ‘I played in 2001 and won, then lost one in 2002. The cup final is big in Norway, there is only one cup and, like the FA Cup, it’s the last game of the season and is always sold out. ‘I have seen crazy things at the cup final. Things like: “Who is going to sit beside the King?” That’s how it is with small clubs. Not here.’ He believes Celtic are favourites to win because they have the bigger squad. More options. Those options will be diminished if Nir Bitton, an increasingly influential midfielder, fails to overcome a swollen ankle. But Kris Commons is fit again and ready. ‘Kris trained yesterday (Thursday) and looked good,’ reported Deila. ‘Adam Matthews is a bit too early. Bitton will hopefully reach it, though he has still not trained. But he is very determined, so hopefully he will reach it. ‘We will give him until Sunday because he is a very important player. We want him to play and I think he has a good chance.’ That Celtic have the personnel is beyond doubt. There will be more focus at Hampden on the discipline of the teams. Dundee United manager Jackie McNamara poses with the Celtic boss and the League Cup at Hampden . So edgy and ill-tempered – and hugely enjoyable - was the Scottish Cup tie between these two teams at Tannadice last Sunday that people are already looking for ‘afters.’ Evidence of bad blood which might lead to another day of big decisions and navel-gazing over the state of Scottish refereeing. Warning his team to keep their discipline, Deila recalled: ‘It was the same against Rangers. If you lose your discipline there and get a red card you can lose the game. ‘I think we have been disciplined. Last Sunday some things happened after a situation. ‘Again, when something happens like that you must keep discipline and focus. So I expect my players to do that in every game now. ‘We have to be disciplined. We have to think and we have to not do stupid things. Stay on your feet and nothing will happen. ‘You have to have controlled aggression. John Collins is always saying that. We have to be determined and high on motivation and aggression. ‘We have to be clear thinkers about what to do in certain situations. We want the team to be like that and we want to be the same way.’ Chief Executive Peter Lawwell and Deila pictured after Celtic announce new agreement with New Balance . He locked his players away in a form of exile at their Lennoxtown training ground before the Rangers game and has employed similar tactics this week. Nothing has been left to chance. The Scottish League Cup gets a bad press. The crowds are poor, the interest levels low. The semi-finals were played on a Hampden pitch better suited to Chinese rice farmers, but a new surface has been laid for the final and Deila gave it the all-clear after a brief walkabout on Thursday. The prospect of a new Celtic manager going for his first trophy in charge sets a new narrative for Sunday. Nothing will be left to chance in pursuit of the prize. ‘All I do is go to Lennoxtown and then go home,’ said Deila. ‘You have to prepare for whatever is coming up, the next game all the time, and it has been a usual week for us. ‘We have big goals and one of them is to win trophies. The other is to develop the club in the direction I want it to go and they want it to go. ‘We have started well. The first year is always so hard wherever you go. You have to get people to understand what you believe in and you have to get to know people. If we can start by winning a trophy on Sunday, it would be a very good start.’", "answer": ["Celtic play Dundee United in the Scottish League Cup final on Sunday .\nRonny Deila's side are bidding to win the domestic treble this season .\nDeila says losing cup final in Norway was the worst thing he has done ."], "label": "SUM"}

'If you're a confident striker the ball will always fall to you in the right positions,' Austin said. 'If you're in form there's nothing stopping you picking the ball up 25 yards out and having a shot, whereas a striker low on confidence might play it out wide and be slightly more conservative. 'If you get the goal to kick-start the run, your self-belief keeps growing and you know you'll keep getting chances to score.'

'If you set yourself a target you can give yourself something to achieve, but if you don't hit those aims you see yourself as a failure. 'For me that isn't a motivation.

He had already taken part in the Battle of the Atlantic - the cat-and-mouse conflict between Allied ships and German U-boats over the vital supply routes from Europe to the United States. At one stage he was part of the boarding party that captured one of the Enigma coding machines, used by the Nazis to scramble messages, from an enemy submarine.

{"question": "A Queensland grandmother, banned from any contact with children after being charged with the attempted murder of her two step-grandchildren, has moved into an apartment across the road from two schools after being released on bail this week. The woman, 58, allegedly tried to kill the two boys, aged nine and 11, by setting fire to their bedroom with an accelerant and 'intentionally impeding' their escape route. She has been been charged with four counts of attempted murder of children, attempted arson and interfering with a corpse in a Morayfield home, north of Brisbane, between April 2013 and September 2014. The Courier-Mail has now revealed the grandmother has moved within metres of Ipswich West Primary School and a special school, after her release from Brisbane Women’s Correctional Centre on bail this week. Scroll down for video . 'The last photo of me and my grandson': The grandmother of the youngest child who died in Queensland's 'house of horrors' claimed he was murdered . The alleged crimes all occurred at a home in Morayfield, north of Brisbane, when the grandmother was present . In January, the Queensland Magistrates court granted the woman bail on the condition she find somewhere to live where she would have no contact with anyone under the age of 18. According to the the Courier Mail, angry parents outside the Queensland schools yesterday were demanding to know why they hadn't been informed and for the grandmother to be moved. The woman's laywer, Michael Bosscher, said one of the conditions of his client’s bail was that she had no direct contact with children but said the court didn't consider the move a risk. 'The court, when hearing her bail application, was aware of the proximity of the primary school and, given the nature of the charges, doesn’t consider her to be any particular risk to children,'  Mr Bosscher said.

Firefighters remove the bed from the makeshift home. Police believe the children were deliberately blocked from exiting their bedroom . Detectives allege the grandmother tried to kill her two step grandsons, aged 9 and 11, by using an accelerant to set fire to a bed and holding their bedroom door closed. The children survived the fire with burns to their lower limbs, but a forensic recreation of the arson attack led detectives to believe someone had deliberately blocked their escape route from the bedroom. Police say the woman had twice before tried to suffocate the 11-year-old with a pillow and a tea towel as he slept. 'To have it happen to defenceless children is just mind-boggling,' said Detective Acting Superintendent Damien Hansen of the crimes. Police have also accused the grandmother of killing a three-year-old boy in 2013, and a seven-month old baby, her grandson, in the same 'house of horrors' in 2014. At the time, the younger children's deaths were explain as SIDS [Sudden Infant Death Syndrome] but police say the grandmother, who was present at the Morayfield home when both children died, had moved the baby from her own bedroom to make it look like he had died in a cot. The father of the three-year-old, who had separated from the boy's mother, pleaded in 2013 for anyone with information to come forward and help police. '(My son) was a really healthy little boy,' he said at the time. 'When I got the call that night he was at the hospital, something didn’t add up - he was a healthy three-year-old boy.

{"question": "(CNN)A chiseled boxer's Instagram feed shows him making constant references to the Bible and enjoying gospel singing with his wife. Another features his formidable opponent counting stacks of money, hanging out in strip clubs, and flashing diamond watches and Ferraris. Welcome to the world of boxing promotion, circa 2015. American Floyd Mayweather and Filipino Manny Pacquiao are set to officially announce their heavily anticipated boxing match at a press conference in Los Angeles Wednesday. With the combined purse for the May 2 bout in Las Vegas reported to touch $300 million pending viewership numbers, the incentives to self-promote could not be higher. \"Nowadays you have to be on social media to launch the fight and to build hype,\" says boxing promoter Nisse Sauerland, CEO of Team Sauerland. \"It couldn't be done without it.\" Thirty-eight year old Mayweather (47-0, 26 knockouts), who favors the moniker \"The Money Man\" or \"TBE\" (The Best Ever), boasts nearly five million Instagram followers, 5.65 million followers on Twitter and 9.2 million Facebook likes. He famously confirmed the fight via Shots, a photo sharing social media application that he's invested in, and displays links to his clothing brand, The Money Team, on all his accounts. Along with professing to the be the best fighter of all time, he could also stake a claim to be one of the greatest social media users in sports. \"I think they're both playing their roles,\" says Sauerland, who promotes over 45 boxers. \"You've got the bad guy and the good guy, really. You've got the guy who throws the money around (Mayweather), that's his image, and Pacquiao, he's the hope of a nation.\" Although Pacquiao (57-5-2, 38 knockouts) also sports millions of followers, his social media numbers lag behind that of his opponent. The 36-year-old Filipino counts 1.7 million followers on Twitter and just 647,000 on Instagram, although his popularity on Facebook is much closer, with 6.3 million page likes. Has this disparity had an impact on Pacquiao's share of the fight's heady purse, which is reported to be split 60/40 in favor of Mayweather? \"If you have five million Twitter followers it does give you power in negotiation, because it reflects popularity, \" says Sauerland. \"But Mayweather needs Pacquiao too; you need  a storyline to make a good fight ... (Pacquiao) is the route to make it the biggest purse in history.\" The disparity is probably due to Pacquiao's less flashy posts. Without exception, they show him in training, in church, or with family -- always with a nod to Jesus in the text -- as well as his nationality, says sports media consultant Daniel McLaren and Cast Digital chief executive officer. \"Manny is a little bit more of a private person; he's not going to be as outspoken and give away as much, so he's always going to have a smaller following,\" he says, while noting that Instagram is less popular outside of North America and Europe. Pacquiao's followers in his home country are more likely to track his moves on Facebook and Twitter, adds McLaren. Either way, both fighters are likely to experience a surge in followers. \"If the only place you can find out what's happening behind the scenes in the lead-up to the fight is via their social media feeds, you're going to follow them,\" McLaren says. \"So I think they will see quite a big increase in followers and the amount of mentions they're getting as the fight gets closer.\" Athletes who participate in individual sports are more inclined to be active on social media, says McLaren, because they don't receive regular salaries, and product endorsements can be a much larger portion of their income. \"A boxer or a golfer or a tennis player has to use it as a commercial platform or a brand building platform,\" he says. \"If you have the choice between a different number of athletes to sponsor, and one has a million Instagram followers while the other doesn't go on social media, then it's a no-brainer.\" Sauerland agrees. \"Every fighter nowadays should be on social media, and if they're not, then they're not doing a good enough job at promoting themselves,\" he says. \"It doesn't matter who you are, whether you're a club fighter or a superstar.\" \"It'll be an interesting fight,\" adds McLaren, \"just because they are so different.\"", "answer": ["Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao bout set to be the largest purse in boxing history .\nFighters take to social media to boost  viewership .\nInstagram accounts highlight personality clash ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "Former German leader Helmut Schmidt today stunned his countrymen by revealing he cheated on his wife during their 68-year marriage. The disclosure came when extracts of his new autobiography were printed in a German magazine. 'I had a relationship with another woman,' said Schmidt, who lost his wife Loki five years ago. Schmidt, 96, revealed his deepest personal secret in his book What I Still Want To Say, which is being serialised by the magazine Stern. He would not reveal the identity of his mistress nor how long the affair lasted. Former German Chancellor Helmut Schimdt  has admitted to having an affair during his 68-year marriage to Loki (pictured, above, with her husband in 2009) sometime in the late 60s or early 70s . 'It was at the end of the 60s or the beginning of the 70s,' he said, adding that his wife found out about it. He said she realised how 'close' it was and offered to leave him. 'I told her that was a totally fallacious idea,' he added. According to Stern, the woman was a colleague in the social democrat party which he led. He remained in contact with her 'for a long while' after the break up and attended her funeral two years ago. Back in the day: Schmidt (left) is pictured with then-British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on St Giorgio's Island for a summit of leaders of the European Economic Community in 1980 . Following the death of his wife, he began a relationship with Ruth Loah, 81, his long-time secretary and they are still together. 'Ruth saved my life,' said Schmidt, who was chancellor of Germany from 1974 until 1982. During his time as West Germany's chancellor he lead the country through Cold War tensions and a bloody wave of terror by far-left radicals, the Red Army Faction. He won the Iron Cross for his services in WWII which included action on both the eastern and western fronts.

{"question": "Sydney Siege survivor Marcia Mikhael has revealed she contemplated suicide after she was the victim of an online hate campaign, where people accused her of cashing in on her terrifying ordeal. Ms Mikhael was one of 18 people who were held hostage on December 15 by gunman Man Haron Monis for almost 17 hours inside the Lindt cafe at Martin Place in Sydney's CBD. She and other victims of the siege were reportedly paid to tell their stories on rival networks Channel Seven and Channel Nine in January. Scroll down for video . Marcia Mikhael appeared in an interview on Channel Seven back in January and told of her ordeal during the Sydney Siege . Man Haron Monis held 18 people hostage inside the Lindt cafe in Sydney on December 15 . Ms Mikhael told the Blacktown Sun was bullied online after her lawyer told media she wanted a six-figure sum to tell her story in a television appearance. 'I went from being a victim and a hero to a villain, police basher,' the mother-of-three said. 'When all the bullying started I actually thought about killing myself. 'Every single one of the hostages received a payout from either Channel Seven or Nine. So why am I the only greedy monster?' Ms Mikhael said she had donated an unspecified amount of money from her television appearance and magazine interview to mental health service Lifeline. The Westpac project manager also revealed she had flashbacks and nightmares about the siege. Ms Mikhael said she had been slammed on social media, accused of profiting out of her terrifying experience . Katrina Dawson (right), who died in the siege, and Ms Mikhael were forced to stand side-by-side in the window on December 15 . She said she did not trust people anymore and was 'terrified' to go out. The 43-year-old added she had undergone two surgeries on each leg to remove more than 200 pieces of shrapnel. One of her comments during her interview on Channel Seven, which drew the most controversy, was how she thought the army could have handled it better than the NSW police who she said could have been more proactive in their approach. Ms Mikhael told the Blacktown Sun those comments had been taken out of context, adding she had thanked the police for saving her early on in the interview.

In January during her Channel Seven appearance, Ms Mikhael told reporter Mel Doyle how she shouted out to officers to let them know where she was on the floor, next to Katrina Dawson. When Monis fired the deadly shot to the back of Tori Johnson's head, Ms Mikhael and Ms Dawson were side-by-side, and also in the firing line. 'As soon as the second shot took place, and she looked at me, and then she puts her hands on her face and she puts her face down, like to protect her face. 'And I kind of go into a foetal position, you know, and my legs get hit. Both legs were in agony.' Ms Dawson and Mr Johnson were two of three people killed during the siege.

{"question": "I don't know how it happened, but suddenly my daughter Valentina is about to turn 18. I wanted to spend some time together - just the two of us - before she flies the nest. We've always lived in London, but Valentina has a keen interest in the animal world and longed to know more about the mysterious orca whale. We decided we would see these magnificent creatures in their natural habitat. Skimming the internet, I found a site called Sea Kayak Adventures, offering a five-day sea kayaking trip in the middle of August in northern British Columbia, Canada. Fins couldn't be better for Julietta in her kayak in the Johnstone Strait in Canada . We would kayak to base camp on the Johnstone Strait and from there take daily excursions, paddling among the pods of orcas that come back year after year during the months of July and August. The website said there would be a 97 per cent chance of seeing an orca during these two months. I booked immediately. The weekend before our departure, a kit list arrived by email. It was also clear from our itinerary that we would be without any showers, hot water, electrical power or wi-fi during our time in the wilderness. We were told to bring fast-drying synthetic clothes and whittle our possessions down to the essentials. Valentina insisted on bringing her camera equipment, which turned out to be a wise choice. We flew to Vancouver, took a small aircraft to Port Hardy, and then drove to Telegraph Cove. Even the experience of preparing for the expedition was exciting. Valentina, who normally expresses all the usual teenage behaviour and reactions, could not have been a more delightful and relaxed travel companion. We laughed out loud when we were given our two tiny watertight kitbags, which would contain our only belongings for the next five days and which we would carry in our kayak. When they 'breach', they jump fully out of the water; a 'spy hop' involves them having a quick look around to see what's going on; and at night they 'fin slap', which sounds like a gun going off . Our group also included a couple, a single man, Joe, and two excellent guides, Julia and Qui. We set off from Telegraph Cove after a briefing on safety, security and weather conditions. On that first day, we kayaked down the strait to a beautiful stony beach where we ate lunch - salad, eggs, ham, cheese and fruit - prepared by Julia and Qui. Afterwards, as we headed back towards camp, we found ourselves right in the path of a pod. They were moving quickly towards us, occasionally with their fins above the water and 'blowing' through their noses. Watching these animals glide majestically through the water was breathtaking. The guide had asked us to 'raft' our kayaks together so that we could make a larger body in the water above them. They submerged about 300ft in front of us, and I hardly dared breathe as they swam beneath us. I could have reached out and touched them. From that moment on we realised that humans really do not belong in a place like the Johnstone Strait. The animal kingdom was around us at all times: sea lions, humpback whales, bald eagles, jellyfish, dolphins, porpoises. Kayakers raft their vessels together as a killer whale approaches in the Johnstone Strait . This was their world, not ours. Our base camp was beautiful, our tent pitched just a few yards from the beach. Our bathroom, meanwhile, was a makeshift wooden cubicle some distance away in the woods. We quickly fell asleep on our first night, but I awoke with a start to what sounded like a bear cracking through the undergrowth. A few minutes later I realised it was squirrels high up in the trees above throwing nuts and cones down on to our tent. Julia and Qui laughed at me, and assured me that bears and cougars are a very rare sight in Telegraph Cover. Valentina and I spent five extraordinary days in the Johnstone Strait. The water was calm and the sun shone brightly. We tracked pods every day. At times they would come and scratch their backs just yards from the beach at our base camp. In the morning the whales would gun down the Strait as if they were on the school run, then at dusk they would drift back slowly, as if they were heading home at the end of a busy day. We soon learned something of their habits. When they 'breach', they jump fully out of the water; a 'spy hop' involves them having a quick look around to see what's going on; and at night they 'fin slap', which sounds like a gun going off. Julietta and her group at the water's edge at Telegraph Cove near Port Hardy . Our guides told us not to be frightened as no one has ever been hurt, let alone killed, by a whale in the Johnstone Strait. Julia had a microphone that goes underwater and when the whales were close we could listen to them communicating with each other as any family would do. It was a deeply emotional experience to hear them conversing, especially knowing the terrible isolation they experience in confinement and captivity. The local whale-watching boats know the pods well. Each pod has a name and can be distinguished by the sound of their communication under the water - each family makes different sounds. Every day was more beautiful than the last. We became calm and relaxed among the whales, waiting for them to reappear, then easing back in our kayaks to take photographs. We grew accustomed to the quiet, and it was a relief to be far away from home, with no access to emails or phones. On our final night after dinner we added to the collected sculpture of pebbles left by previous kayakers - stones rendered heart-shaped by the lap of the waves. I asked Valentina if she had ever been in a situation where there was no wi-fi, no connectivity, and no communication with her friends - a time when she was simply a human being in the stillness of our planet. She said that while she missed talking to her friends and sharing her experiences, she actually found it deeply relaxing not to have to listen to the constant chatter. On the final night I was desperate for a shower. Without one, I opted for the next best thing - a dip in the freezing sea. It crossed my mind that I was swimming in Mother Nature's pool. Julietta and Valentina came face to face with a black bear during their trip . The next morning I walked alone down to the creek to take in the unbelievable beauty of our surroundings one last time. That's when I spotted a big black bear right in front of me, grunting through his huge nostrils. As soon as he saw me he started to lollop away into the undergrowth. I stood still, then shouted to Valentina that she should come outside with her camera. The bear hung around just long enough for her to take an out-offocus photograph. An adventure like this was made much more special for me because I shared it with my daughter. Travelling can be stressful, but we were almost always in good spirits, and in harmony with one another. We have memories that will never leave us. To have an experience like that with my daughter who will soon embark on adult life was something I shall treasure for ever. I know she enjoyed every second of it too. GETTING THERE . Sea Kayak Adventures (seakayakadventures.com) offers a six-day Blackfish Waters Orca Kayak tour from US$1,545pp (about £1,025).

{"question": "When Nick Clegg walked out of today's farcical ‘yellow budget’ speech, it prompted relentless jeers from Labour MPs - and left Danny Alexander speaking to a virtually-empty chamber. And, to add insult to injury, the Deputy Prime Minister's swift exit appeared to be for the sole purpose of trying his hand at a spot of Am-dram in Gravesend.

There were even reports that he interacted with dancing girls for the film. At one point, Mr Clegg opted for an outfit swap, changing into a camel-coloured jacket, which he matched with a more severe facial expression, as he walked solo along the high street. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the political broadcast is not the first time that Mr Clegg has attempted some amateur acting. The politician is said to have enjoyed Am-dram at school, taking the lead role in The Government Inspector while at Caldicott. At Westminster,  he took the lead in The Changeling, opposite Hollywood actress in-the-making Helena Bonham Carter. In one scene, she had to kick him between the legs - and one night she hit the target rather too authentically. 'She got it spot on… no acting was required,' Clegg recalls.

{"question": "Barcelona may never have been here today. Not the team harboring the awesome power of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez up front. Not the club who have won four European Cups and so many domestic trophies they require a small cave rather than a mere cabinet to hold them. Irishman Patrick 'Paddy' O'Connell is credited with rescuing Barcelona from extinction . The awesome trio of Neymar, Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez may not have been assembled if not for O'Connell . Not Luis Enrique's side who are aiming to knock Manchester City out of the last 16 of the Champions League. All of that is unlikely to have existed were it not for Irishman Patrick 'Paddy' O'Connell, who as a player captained the red side of Manchester during five years at United from 1914 but has inadvertently played a crucial role in setting up City's two-legged fixture with Barcelona a century later. O'Connell is credited with rescuing Barcelona from extinction during his time in charge between 1935 and 1940. Barcelona have enjoyed great success in recent years but it was O'Connell that saved the club . In Spain, he became known as 'Don Patricio' - a title reserved for royalty or noblemen - for his successes after moving over aged 35 and first leading Racing de Santander to five regional titles before becoming one of the founding members of La Liga. He took charge at Real Oviedo and then won the Spanish title at Real Betis, but his greatest legacy was shaped when Barcelona came calling. After just one season at the Catalan club, the Spanish Civil War broke out in July 1936 and the country was in chaos. O'Connell (back row, far right) pictured for Ireland against Wales in 1914/1915 . On the streets of Barcelona, anarchy was escalating. As the tanks rolled in, football was flattened in the country. La Liga was suspended and, despite playing in and winning the Mediterranean League, cash was running out fast. The club were facing financial ruin. O'Connell orchestrated himself and the players taking a huge wage cut - reducing his salary by a third from $1,500 to $1,000 - but Barcelona were still heading out of business, until the wily Irishman had a bright idea. Barcelona celebrate with the Champions League trophy following victory over Manchester United in 2009 . Former Barcelona captain and defender Carles Puyol  holds the Champions League trophy in Rome . He took the team on a tour of Mexico and America, playing 14 games and raising $5,000 - the equivalent of $83,000 today. It was little, but enough to survive. By the time the war ended in April 1939, O'Connell had dragged the team back from the brink of oblivion. Why then would this Barca legend  come to die alone and penniless in London 20 years later? While O'Connell is remembered so fondly in those sunnier climes, on our own shores an entirely different character is recalled by those he should have loved dearest. 'He was the hero in one way but also the swine who left his family in poverty,' his grandson Mike remembered. 'There are two sides to it, a sad family story, but I'm proud he was my grandfather.' O'Connell (back row, one from the left) as part of the Hull City team in 1913-14 . O'Connell was a gambler and a misogynist; a chancer, swindler and trickster. He played for Belfast Celtic, Sheffield Wednesday and Hull City before impressing Manchester United enough for them to pay £1,000 for his services in May 1914. The same year he captained Ireland to the British Home Championship, playing the final game against Scotland with a broken arm. O'Connell was a brash, brazen, no-nonsense centre-back and was made captain of United straight away. However, the first season was a catastrophe and they avoided relegation from Division One by a single point. Even worse - a victory against Liverpool in April was deemed fixed. Puyol holds up the Club World Cup trophy after victory against Santos FC at the tournament in Yokohama . Sandy Turnbull and Enoch 'Knocker' West photographed in 'cricketing' pose at Old Trafford in 1911 . The First World War had broken out and no football was to be played the following season. A group of United and Liverpool players, fearing unemployment and what the future held, met in a pub the day before the game and agreed to the more unlikely 2-0 United win and bet on it at odds of seven-to-one. The scam was uncovered when the Football Association investigated claims of a lack of effort from Liverpool players. United's Sandy Turnbull, Enoch West, Arthur Whalley, and Liverpool's Thomas Fairfoul, Tom Miller, Bob Pursell and Jackie Sheldon were banned indefinitely by the FA. Former Barca man Cesc Fabregas holds the  UEFA Super Cup after beating Porto at Louis II Stadium . Bob Pursell was banned after rigging a game to win money when Liverpool faced Manchester United . Liverpool's Jackie Sheldon was one of those players banned indefinitely by the FA . Liverpool's Thomas Fairfoul was also banned for his part in the corrupt game between the rival teams . O'Connell struck a penalty well wide with the score at 2-0, but somehow avoided punishment. Yet O'Connell's family admit that maverick streak ran through him. It was these scrapes and scraps which shaped an eventual legend. 'He was an incredible success as a footballer but as a man he was probably a bit of loveable rogue,' Mike's wife Sue explained. 'As a father he was a non-starter.' He remained a United player through the war and after it ended had a year at Dumbarton before moving to Ashington in 1920. David Beckham is one of 40 players who have supported a fund  to raise money for a fitting memorial . O'Connell was determined to find success in football and would let nothing stand in his way. Not even family. He left his wife Ellen at Newcastle station in 1920 after she had travelled there to plead with him to return home. It was the last time O'Connell would see her and he married again in Spain, another Irishwoman called Ellen. At Ashington, he was made player-manager and had his first taste in running a club, before the sniff of adventure took him abroad. Johan Cruyff has also supported the plea to get O'Connell a more fitting memorial following his death . But for all his heroics in Spain, when O'Connell returned to England in 1958 he faded into destitution before he died in London a year later where he remains in an unmarked grave. Last year, a fund was set up to raise money for a more fitting memorial. So far, more than 40 notable football names have supported it, including Sir Bobby Charlton, Johan Cruyff, Franz Beckenbauer, Paolo Maldini and David Beckham. There is a bust of O'Connell in the FC Barcelona Museum. There, he will always be remembered as the man who saved the club.

{"question": "Branko Loncar, 55, won a long legal battle against being returned to Croatia to serve four years in prison for attempted murder . A man who shot his dying wife 14 times as she was hanging from a noose can continue to live freely in Britain – after judges refused to extradite him. Branko Loncar, 55, has won a long legal battle against being returned to Croatia to serve four years in prison for attempted murder, despite committing further crimes, including an assault, while living in London. He earlier won asylum after complaining he had to flee Croatia because of anti-Serb discrimination – and his lawyers argued locals would persecute him over the shooting. Last week’s High Court ruling is a sharp reminder that while the Government talks of ejecting foreign criminals, in practice the criminals routinely win the right to stay here. Loncar, who has been on benefits and had a drink problem since arriving in Britain with his two sons in 1999, made the extraordinary defence that he was not aiming at his wife when he fired repeatedly from a few yards away. In any case, his lawyers claimed, she died as a result of hanging herself, not because of the 14 bullets he ‘accidentally’ fired into her defenceless body. A Croatian court which heard the case in his absence rejected his defence, sentenced him to four years in prison, and ten years ago the country formally issued an international arrest warrant and requested his extradition from Britain. His lawyers first successfully fought against the extradition on human rights grounds, arguing that he had a new Serbian ‘partner’ in Britain – who actually lives a hundred miles away – and that he now had grandchildren in London. And last week British judges finished off the extradition bid for ever, giving Loncar the right to remain free here, after ruling it ‘oppressive’ to send him back to prison in Croatia after so long. He was also commended for raising his children alone after shooting his wife. Speaking in broken English to the Daily Mail last night at his housing association flat close to fashionable Camden in North London, Loncar said he had every right to remain in Britain, adding: ‘Croatia is dangerous – they still want me there.’ The case began in 1994, amid the chaos of the Balkan wars, when Loncar, an ethnic Serb and former soldier in the Yugoslavian army, lived with his wife Mirjana and two sons in the village of Ostrovo. The area was declared part of a Serbian republic but was also claimed by Croatia. UK court documents note: ‘After a quarrel with his wife Mirjana, she went out of the house, stood on a ladder, took a rope and indicated she intended to kill herself. As she stood from the ladder and the noose tightened around her neck and rendered her unconscious, the defendant fired a number of bullets into her body. ‘The cause of death was determined to be by strangulation but was accelerated by the injuries inflicted from the defendant’s gun. The defendant was charged with murder.’ The subsequent trial – by a Serbian court – heard that Loncar had fired 14 shots from his handgun ‘causing a number of injuries’. Last week, British judges finished off the extradition bid for ever, giving Loncar the right to remain free in the UK, by ruling in the High Court (pictured) that it would be ‘oppressive’ to send him back to prison in Croatia . He told the court ‘that when he saw that his wife had jumped off the ladder, he took the gun and ammunition out of the holster he had under his arm and fired the gun from three to four metres away, but did not know in which direction.’ After a single pathologist claimed Mrs Loncar had already died of strangulation before being shot, he was initially cleared of murder. In 1999 he then flew to England with his children and successfully claimed asylum, saying that his ethnic Serbian children were discriminated against by Croatians at school – but also complaining of ‘local antipathy resulting from the death of his wife’. While he began a life on benefits here, Croatia’s supreme court in 2000 ordered a retrial, with Loncar’s village now a part of Croatia, and the following year he was convicted in his absence of attempted murder. Four doctors said Mrs Loncar was still alive when her husband shot her. He was given a four-year prison sentence on the grounds that he ‘had an intention to kill’. Croatia, a member of the European Union, some years later sought Loncar’s extradition, and in 2006 British police arrested him. A UK court swiftly rejected the request, noting with sympathy that he had to bring up his children alone after shooting his wife. But in 2014 he was arrested again, and although he was immediately freed on bail the case was sent to the High Court in London. Last week’s High Court judgment in Loncar’s favour, by judges Lord Justice Aiken and Mrs Justice Popplewell, the conclusion of the long legal battle, noted: ‘The offence for which the extradition of Mr Loncar is sought is undoubtedly a very serious one. Moreover, Mr Loncar has not led a blameless life as a British citizen. ‘He has a caution for theft in 2012 and a conviction for common assault in 2013. Nevertheless we have reached the firm conclusion that it would be oppressive to extradite Mr Loncar by reason of the passage of time.’ The ruling was also sharply critical of the Croatian legal system, and observed that he had served a year in prison before being initially cleared almost 20 years ago. And in reference to the Human Rights Act’s ‘right to a family life’ clause, judges said Loncar had ‘been in a relationship with the same partner since prior to 2006, although they do not live together’. Far from living together, the Daily Mail has discovered that ‘partner’ helping provide him with a ‘family life’ to maintain here is an ethnic Serb born in Britain and living 100 miles from him in Leicester.", "answer": ["Branko Loncar, 55, moved to UK after being cleared of murdering his wife .\nHe won asylum by claiming he fled country due to anti-Serb discrimination .\nBut Croatian court convicted him in his absence during a retrial in 2000 .\nCroatia asked for his extradition from UK in 2005 but lawyers fought move .\nThey said he had right to family life with new Serbian partner in the UK .\nLoncar continued claiming benefits and was convicted of common assault .\nHigh Court has now ruled it  'oppressive' to send Loncar back after so long ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "(CNN)Seven college-age people, some who came to Panama City Beach, Florida, for spring break, were wounded in a late-night shooting, the Bay County Sheriff's Office said in a press release. Officers met \"complete chaos\" when they tried to find out what happened not long after midnight Friday, Sheriff Frank McKeithen told CNN affiliate WMBB when interviewed on the scene. Video showed the streets teeming with young people. Three people with gunshot wounds were found inside a house, one outside the house, one in the median of the road and two on the other side of the road, the sheriff's office said in a press release. \"We have about 100 witnesses or so that we are trying to separate and interview,\" McKeithen told WMBB.  \"We have a mess.\" The scene was so mixed up that deputies from five adjacent counties and officers from the Florida Highway Patrol and Panama City Beach police were called in to assist. The shooting occurred at a residence on Thomas Drive, the main drag in the beach town. Several of the victims were students from Alabama A&M University who were visiting town for spring break, the sheriff's office said. They're between 20 and 22 years of age. During February and March, up to six million young people visit Panama City Beach, which some have been dubbed \"the Spring Break Capital of the World.\" The Panhandle town has a resident population of about 12,000. Some of the young people were shot multiple times. They were taken to area hospitals, where three were listed in critical condition and three in stable condition, the sheriff's office said. The seventh person was in surgery when the press release was issued and no update on his condition was provided. Authorities arrested David Jarmichael Daniels, 22, of Mobile, Alabama, on seven counts of attempted murder. A .40-caliber pistol was found in the backyard of a residence.

{"question": "Playing with Thierry Henry turned Bradley Wright-Phillips into the MLS's top goal scorer last season. The duo had chemistry and the result was one of those seasons that will be hard to beat, with the Englishman scoring 27 goals in 32 games and winning the league's golden boot. Doing it again might be a lot tougher. Henry, the French international who brought immense talent and recognition to the league, has retired and Wright-Phillips is going to have to go through an adjustment period. Bradley Wright-Phillips (left) didn't have a shot in the Red Bulls' season opener against Sporting Kansas City . Thierry Henry retired at the end of the season meaning Wright-Phillips has a new strike partner . The Red Bulls have revamped their roster and Henry isn't the only one gone. Australian international Tim Cahill has departed along with fellow midfielder Eric Alexander. In the season opening tie against Sporting Kansas City, Wright-Phillips didn't have a shot. 'I don't have to readjust my game,' the 30-year-old Englishman said after the Red Bulls practiced for their home opener against D.C. United on Sunday. 'I am always going to play the same way I always have. The players that have come in, I'm trying to learn like I did with Thierry. I learned how he played and I learned to play off him. I'll try to do the same with the new guys.' The additions this season are midfielders Sacha Kljestan and Felipe Martins and striker Mike Grella. But in the 1-1 season-opening draw, the chemistry was lacking up front. 'On the day of the game I put a lot of it down to me,' Wright-Phillips said. 'I was a bit too eager to get behind. I could have done a little bit better with my runs. It's the first game, I don't really lose my mind after a first game of the season.' If there is a difference this season it's the style of the Red Bulls' play under new coach Jesse Marsch. There is an emphasis on moving the ball quickly with everybody contributing. A lot went through Henry in past seasons. The New York Red Bulls drew 1-1 with Sporting Kansas City in their first MLS game of the season . 'For us, it was almost a little unrealistic having a guy like Thierry on the team,' Red Bulls captain and midfielder Dax McCarty said. 'He was a little of a wild card, a joker. If you are losing or in a bad situation, you could just play him the ball and hope that something magical happened, which more often than not did. That's gone. I think this is a team that can hurt you in numerous ways and that's going to be a big shift this season. McCarty said the team could have helped Wright-Phillips more in the opening game. 'We didn't create enough chances for Bradley,' McCarty said. 'I think he will admit he can do a better job making better runs and we have a do a better job of looking for him and finding him when he does make those good runs. That is the thing that is going to make us successful this season. Wright-Phillips isn't heading into the season thinking: how does he top last year? He has set a goal target that he is not disclosing. If he meets it, he'll set another one. Whatever he does, Wright-Phillips isn't interested in heading back to England, where he played for Manchester City, Southampton, Plymouth Argyle, Charlton Athletic and Brentford before coming to the Red Bulls in July 2013. 'I don't want to go back to Europe. I've said that several times,' Wright-Phillips said. 'There were one or two whispers that I heard about but it doesn't interest me. I'm playing for the New York Red Bulls and I love living in New Jersey.' Wright-Phillips says he has no desire of coming back to England and is enjoying life in the USA .", "answer": ["Thierry Henry retired from football at the end of the season .\nBradley Wright-Phillips was the MLS's top scorer last year .\nNew York Red Bulls striker says he won't change playing style .\nEnglishman also insists he has no desire of returning to play in Europe ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "He's the internet-savvy modern leader who cuddles up to kittens and hobnobs with film stars on his wildly popular Instagram page. But Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov is also a former warlord accused of running the Russian republic 'like a medieval tyrant'. The 38-year-old came to power in 2007 after a vicious armed struggle with a number of other Chechen strongmen and a political battle with the man he succeeded as leader, Alu Alkhanov. Claims that Kadyrov keeps a 'murder list' of 300 names of people to be liquidated surfaced in 2008. Yet the brutal reality of how Kadyrov maintains his grip on power has been glossed over by his social media skills and voracious appetite for posting on Instagram. Scroll down for video . Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov with actress Liz Hurley and a kitten. The Austin Powers star was in Grozny to shoot thriller Turquoise when the snap was taken in May 2013 . Kadyrov in medieval garb. He has posted on his Instagram account kadyrov_95 more than 4,800 times and has an incredible 905,000 followers . The former Chechen warlord lies down for a snooze with a pet tiger. Kadyrov is a fan of the big cats . The father-of-eight has uploaded more than 4,800 posts and has around 905,000 followers to his kadyrov_95 account on the photo-sharing site. He has shown a particular fondness for snaps of himself with cute fluffy kittens, baby birds, lambs and even tigers. In May 2013 he posted snaps of himself with Liz Hurley and a white kitten on Instagram after meeting the actress when she arrived in Chechnya to film thriller Turquoise with French actor Gerard Depardieu. The pair were seen  apparently bonding over the tiny animal having been introduced by Kadyrov's friend Depardieu. In another shot the Chechen strongman leans across the Austin Powers star and runs his finger over the smartphone she is holding as the two appear perfectly at ease with each other. Depardieu met the Chechen leader at his birthday celebrations two years previously and later controversially accepted Russian citizenship after quitting France to avoid a planned 75 per cent tax on millionaires. Left to right: Hurley, Gerard Depardieu and Kadyrov go walkabout in Grozny, where the actors were filming .

The two are seen laughing and joking out and about with Hurley in the Chechen capital Grozny. Kadyrov's fondness for the high life is revealed as the devout Muslim and some of his cronies are seen cruising through the streets of Grozny in a Rolls Royce. Things get weirder as he shows a fondness for medieval costume in another shot and poses with yet more fluffy cats perching on his shoulder and reclining in his arms. The burly enforcer has a go at playing the world's biggest softy as he lovingly cups a baby chick in his enormous hands. And the shots of him with a tiger are probably the most bizarre of all, as he pillows his head on the young big cat on top of an ornate rug and has it on his lap with a lead around its neck as he sits between two associates. And yet this is the man whose widely feared 'Kadyrovtsy' militia several thousand-strong, are accused by human rights groups of involvement in kidnappings, assassinations and torture throughout their patron's rise to power. They were formed during the first Chechen war for independence between 1994 and 1995 when Kadyrov's father, Chechnya's Grand Mufti or highest Islamic official, declared jihad against Russia. The former warlord (centre) and another bizarre snap of him with a tiger which even has lead round its neck .

He rules the once restive Russian republic with an iron fist . Chechnya's president with a baby chick. He also posted this kitten on his wildly popular Instagram account . But the Kadyrov clan switched their allegiance to Moscow at the beginning of the second Chechen war in 1999, since when continued insurgents against the Kremlin have been ruthlessly dealt with by the militia. The paramilitary clashed with forces loyal to fellow warlord Sulmin Yamadayev in March 2008 and a year later Kadyrov's rival was dead, assassinated in Dubai in a hit reputedly ordered by one of Kadyrov's cousins. The son of assassinated former Chechen president Akhmad Kadyrov also prevailed in his fight with paramilitary leader Said-Magomed Kakiyev, while Kadyrov successfully angled for Russian President Vladimir Putin to dismiss Alkhanov and appoint him leader instead. Since then it is widely accepted that Putin has given Kadyrov carte blanche to run Chechnya as his own personal fiefdom, provided he keeps the separatist forces which temporarily ripped the republic from the Kremlin's grasp in the 1990s are kept in check. Aside from Yamadayev a string of other Kadryov opponents have wound up dead in locations stretching from Moscow to Istanbul and Vienna, though the man himself has always denied involvement in any of their killings. Kadyrov hugs a man in a bear suit in front of the neon backdrop of the Chechen capital Grozny's skyline . The former warlord posted this viral video of a panda rolling down a snow covered hill on his Instagram page . This short film of pandas on a slide at the Chengdu Panda Base in China was another posted by Kadyrov . The video has more than 9million times on Youtube, and likely picked up some of those thanks to Kadyrov . Russian investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya was shot dead in the capital in October 2006 while she was reportedly working on a story about torture and human rights abuses in Chechnya. Some observers laid the blame for the killing at Kadyrov's door. A month later Movladi Baisarov, a former commander of the Chechen presidential security services turned Kadyrov opponent, was also shot dead in Moscow. He had branded Kadyrov 'a medieval tyrant', adding: 'If someone tells the truth about what is going on, it's like signing one's own death warrant. 'Ramzan is a law unto himself. He can do anything he likes. He can take any woman and do whatever he pleases with her. 'Ramzan acts with total impunity. I know of many people executed on his express orders and I know exactly where they were buried.' And In a remarkable statement posted on Instagram, Kadyrov praised one of the men charged with the murder of Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov in Moscow as a 'fearless and brave' 'patriot of Russia' who was 'ready to give his life for the Motherland'.", "answer": ["Ramzan Kadyrov is burly former warlord accused of being 'medieval tyrant'\nCame to power after vicious armed struggle with other Chechen strongmen .\nImplicated in torture and dozens of assassinations, including Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, gunned down in Moscow last month .\nBut poses as gentle animal-loving giant on wildly popular Instagram page .\nPosts shots of him cuddling tigers, fluffy kittens, baby birds and lambs .\nSchmoozes film stars Liz Hurley and Gerard Depardieu in Chechen capital .\nCruises round Grozny in Rolls Royce and lauds patron Vladimir Putin .\nHas posted more than 4,800 times and has an incredible 905,000 followers ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "France is filled with foreboding about the fate that awaits Philippe Saint-Andre's misfiring team at Twickenham. The coach has come in for fierce criticism during another RBS Six Nations campaign of grinding, mid-table mediocrity, but according to two members of the last Gallic team to win a championship match in London, exactly a decade ago, the problems run deeper than the man in charge. Their primary concerns are the mass influx of overseas players into the Top 14 league which has stalled the development of home-grown talent – and the death of French flair. France full back Scott Spedding (left), who was born in South Africa, makes a break against Italy in Rome . Racing Metro flanker Bernard le Roux (centre) is another South African-born player in France's ranks . Clermont winger Noa Nakaitaci (right) was born in Fiji but now represents Les Bleus . Rory Kockott was snapped up by France after the South African scrum half qualified on residency grounds . France coach Philippe Saint-Andre has come in for strong criticism following another mediocre campaign . VIDEO Italy v France - extended highlights . 72 per cent: English players in Premiership match day squads so far this season. 70 per cent: English players in 2014 Aviva Premiership final match day squads. 71 per cent: English players in Premiership sides for last round of Champions Cup. 45 per cent: French players in Top 14 squads, according to French study. 46 per cent: French players in 2014 Top 14 final match day squads. 62 per cent: French players in Top 14 sides for last round of Champions Cup. There is still a mathematical chance that Les Bleus can win the title this weekend, but that is pie in the sky and cannot disguise their chronic limitations. Dimitri Yachvili, the goal-kicking hero of France's 18-17 win at the home of their fiercest rivals in 2005, describes it as a 'bad time for our rugby' and suggests that the booming import trade is the primary issue. 'To me, the problem is that we have too many foreign players in the Top 14 and all the good young French players don't play enough,' said the former Biarritz scrum-half. 'The clubs prefer buying a South African player, or a Kiwi player or an Australian player – maybe because they think it is safer to do that. The young players don't play and that is not good. 'When young players arrive in the French team, they don't have enough experience of the high level. A few years ago, you had to be good for one or two years for your club, before you could be picked for France. Now you just have to do one good move in a match. Former France scrum half Dimitri Yachvili fires out a pass during his side's clash against England in 2004 . Yachvili's sublime goal-kicking performance secured France's last victory at Twickenham back in 2005 . 'Against Wales at Stade de France and against Ireland in Dublin, we were not very far from winning those games, but we are missing the experience that is needed. If we didn't have so many foreign players in our league, the players would have more experience and we could win those games.' Serge Betsen was another stalwart of the France team that stormed the Twickenham barricades 10 years ago. The ex-Biarritz and Wasps flanker is also worried about the lack of player development in his country, adding: 'The politicians need to help the youngsters to get experience at the highest level. English rugby organises things to give their national players priority. 'During my time at Biarritz, I played with Joe Roff, who won the World Cup with Australia. These kind of players showed me how to improve. To be in contact with them is important, but you still need to give opportunities to the youngsters. We've got a lot of talented players like Gael Fickou and Wesley Fofana. But Fickou needs the time to express his talent. I don't know why he hasn't had the time.' Former France flanker Serge Betsen (right) is worried by the amount of overseas players in the Top 14 . Noa Nakaitaci . Once captain of the Fiji schoolboys team, the powerful winger moved to France after Clermont Auvergne set up an academy in the Pacific Islands. He signed with the Top 14 club in 2011 and made his France debut two years later. Rory Kockott . The scrum-half was snapped up by Les Bleus as soon as he became eligible for selection through the three-year residency rule. He was tipped as a Springboks star following his time with the Natal Sharks but was overlooked by South Africa coach Heyneke Meyer. Bernard Le Roux . Despite being born and raised in Moorreesburg, South Africa, the flanker made his rugby debut in Amsterdam. He joined the Border Bulldogs on the Eastern Cape and was offered a deal with the Lions but opted for a move to Racing Metro. Scott Spedding . Born in Krugersdorp, South Africa, the full back came through the Natal Sharks academy and represented the Springboks at Under 21 level. He signed for Brive in 2008 before moving to Bayonne and was granted a French passport last year. The decline of the renowned French flair has been in evidence at Test and club level for several years now. A nation once known for cavalier attacking play which conjured such iconic moments as the fabled 'Try from the end of the earth' in Auckland in 1994 has largely adopted a more pragmatic, Anglo-Saxon reliance on brute force. Asked if his country have tried too hard to play like England, Yachvili said: 'Yes, yes. We have lost our French rugby a little bit, because a lot of foreign players have come to play for the French clubs and they have another culture and another way of playing. We must try to keep the French flair, but I think we have lost that a bit. 'It is in our DNA to play intuitive rugby. We don't have the best organisation and the best game-plans in the world, but what we have more than other nations is this way to attack from everywhere. But we must be open-minded and free to play this rugby, and at the moment I think we're not free.' Betsen echoed his former team-mate, adding: 'England has taken parts of the French to add that X-factor to their game – guys like George Ford – who aren't just about kicking but can spot the gap. 'French rugby tried to follow other nations and copy their way of doing things, but it's not always been effective. We want players to practise weights more than passing, but we need a more holistic approach. The flair comes with confidence and trust. You need panache, enjoyment and excitement; sometimes that's been missing.' What has not been lost along the way is a fervent passion for this classic fixture. The cross-Channel rivalry stirs French blood as much as it ever did. An admiration for those who wear the Red Rose is temporarily shelved at kick-off time. 'We like English rugby, but we hate them just for 80 minutes!' said Yachvili, who spent a season at Gloucester. 'They are very good players, they are very well organised, they have a very good game-plan and we respect them, but for 80 minutes it will always be a very big battle. Betsen believes players such as Gael Fickou (left) and Wesley Fofana are hindered by the current system . 'Of course, it is the biggest game for us. It is historic and it is always special. It is Le Crunch. It is the last game this year and England can still win the Six Nations. For us, we will be more scared before the game than last week or against Wales at home, but I'm hoping we can do something special.' That is certainly what Yachvili did in 2005. It was his special goal-kicking that helped France rally from a 17-6 half-time deficit to win 18-17. As it turns out, he was assisted with his match-winning efforts by an Englishman, whose identity remains a secret. 'It was crazy because, in the captain's run training session the day before the game, my kicking was very bad and my coach was very scared about the game,' he said. 'But in the game, I think one kick hit the post but the rest were good. Giant New Zealand-born prop Uini Atonio (right) is another foreign player that is part of the France squad . 'I broke my kicking tee in the captain's run training session and I had to ask a friend living in London where I could buy a tee, because I wanted the same one. He said the only shop around was at Twickenham, so he went to buy my tee for the game there, but nobody knew it! I will not tell you the name of the friend, but he is English!' France surely won't be short of a tee or two this time, but better preparation may not be enough to end their long wait for a championship win in the English capital. But Yachvili hasn't abandoned all hope. 'When people think we are no good, that is when France do something,' he said – ominously for the home side. 'On paper, we would say England will beat us easily, because their rugby is more efficient and much better than us right now. But with French rugby, we never know.'", "answer": ["England face France in the final round of the Six Nations on Saturday .\nFrance coach Philippe Saint-Andre has been heavily criticised following another disappointing Six Nations campaign .\nDimitri Yachvili concerned by high number of foreign players in Top 14 league .\nYachvili's goal-kicking secured France a 18-17 win at Twickenham in 2005 .\nIt was France's last victory at England HQ .\nSerge Betsen believes France are not developing enough young talent ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "Clarke Carlisle pictured outside of court on Monday . Clarke Carlisle has pleaded guilty to a drink-driving offence that occurred two days before the former footballer tried to kill himself by jumping in front of a lorry. The 35-year-old, still bearing the facial scars from his December 22 suicide attempt in a crash which left him in a coma until mid-January, spoke clearly as he stood in the dock at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court in north London. The former Professional Footballers' Association chairman, who played for Leeds United, Burnley and Queens Park Rangers, admitted failing to provide a sample on December 20. He also pleaded guilty to a charge of driving otherwise than in accordance with a licence on the same date, when police officers spotted a Mercedes travelling in an 'erratic' manner, prosecutor Zahid Hussain said. Deputy District Judge Margaret Dodds told Carlisle that he would 'inevitably' be disqualified when he next appears at the same court for sentencing on May 14. She also ordered that reports be made in the case after being told of Carlisle's medical situation. He had been spotted by police 'swerving' his Mercedes and nearly hitting a lorry on Pentonville Road, north London, on December 20 at about 7am. Mr Hussain said the car was seen 'swerving in the lane, to the pavement on the nearside, almost mounting the pavement' and that the tyres were 'grinding on the curb'. When the officers stopped and spoke to Carlisle, 'alcohol was smelled on his breath', Mr Hussain added. Carlisle discussed his failed suicide attempt in February with Absolute Radio's Jon Champion in what was his first radio appearance since leaving hospital. He said he was 'disgusted' with himself and told family members he 'did not want to be here' when they visited him in Leeds General Infirmary. 'I was only in LGI for three days and throughout those three days my family were coming to see me,' he said. 'Every time I came and felt unconditional love. It was just another point of self loathing. I was disgusted with myself and I said I have to be honest with you 'I still do not want to be here'.

Because these are the people who are coming to love me and care for me. And I'm telling them that in spite of that I want to be dead.' Carlisle revealed he would have been sectioned if he rejected the chance of attending a psychiatric hospital. The lorry driver who struck Carlisle said he may never be able to get behind the wheel again. Darren Pease feared both he and Carlisle would die after glass shattered following the crash, leaving them with cuts to their faces and the driver temporarily blinded. He told the Daily Mirror: 'That feeling is indescribable - to think you are going to die. 'I don't think I'll ever be able to get behind the wheel of a lorry again. I can't see any way back for me at this point. I can't drive a car properly, never mind a wagon. 'All I could think was that I had killed someone. How am I going to live with this?

{"question": "If you find your hour in the gym leaves you exhausted, spare a thought for four determined British women about to embark on an epic adventure that will test them to their limits. The women are attempting to be the first female 4's team to row unsupported across the Pacific Ocean from America to Australia. Throughout the 8,446-mile journey, the women will have to spend  two hours on the oars and two hours off for six months solid. Scroll down for video . The women (front to back, Laura, Natalia and Emma) will be alone on the vast ocean for six months of mentally and physical activity . Laura, Isabel, Natalia and Emma on their rowing machines. 'The main muscle groups we train by doing dead lifts, bench press, leg press, seated row, single arm row and core strengthening,' explains Natalia . The women are attempting to be the first female 4's team to row unsupported across the Pacific Ocean from America to Australia, which will involve spending two hours on the oars and two hours off for six months . Apart from issues like sleep deprivation, adverse weather conditions, injury, salt sores, sun exposure and potential equipment malfunction, the coxless crew also need to train themselves to deal with psychological challenges of  monotony, confined living quarters and limited contact with the outside world. That's on top of the fitness and strength training needed to take on the momentous rowing feat. Yet, the formidable foursome set to  embark on this exceptional journey - in a 29ft long and 7ft wide pink boat called Doris - describe themselves as 'ordinary'. Laura Penhaul, 31, from Cornwall, is a physiotherapist for the Paralympics and is the team leader; Natalia Cohen, 40, from Manchester is a travel operations manager and has spent two decades living in countries in the developing world; Isabel Burnham, 30, from Cambridge works as a solicitor and Emma Mitchell, 29, from Marlow is an expedition manager for a travel company. The coxless crew, who are aiming to raise over a quarter of a million pounds for two charities: Walking With the Wounded and Breast Cancer Care survivors, have just over two weeks to go before they embark upon their voyage. Taking on the challenge of a lifetime: Isabel Burnham,  Laura Penhaul, Emma Mitchell and Natalia Cohen will row the Pacific in a 29ft long and 7ft wide pink boat called Doris . Laura said: 'We say that this row is 85 per cent psychological in how we cope and 15 per cent physical, but our psychological state will be affected by being dehydrated, calorie deficient, sleep deprived and hormone imbalanced. So if we can optimise these variables then it will will help our mental state.' Natalia added: 'Our mental strength is going to be vital. I believe that we all have our own Pacific to cross, in whatever form that comes. 'We want to empower others to have faith  and dig deep to fight and overcome whatever adversity life throws your way. I believe you can do anything you set your mind to.' So how are the brave four ensuring they are in peak mental and physical health? We look at their intense preparation for the dangerous journey of a lifetime. The team (left to right) Isabel, Emma, Natalia and Laura on board their pink boat, Doris, where they will be spending six months as they row 8,446 miles . Emma and Laura in action on board Doris: The four formidable women about to embark on this exceptional journey, describe themselves as 'ordinary' PILING ON POUNDS AND MUSCLE . Natalia said: 'Our physical training  involves weight sessions to increase our lean muscle mass and strengthen certain key areas of the body to help prevent injury. 'The main muscle groups we train by doing dead lifts, bench press, leg press, seated row, single arm row and core strengthening.' The women are also channeling their efforts into gaining weight. They need to increase their body weight by ten to 15 per cent in lean muscle and fat for reserve energy stores. That’s between seven to ten kilos each. The cabin where the team will spend most of their time is  the size of a small-to-medium two-man tent . 'It's not quite as fun as it sounds,' she added. 'Drinking wine and eating lots of cakes and chocolates is unfortunately not the answer to this challenge. 'The weight has to go on in a controlled way, alongside a tailor-made exercise and weight training regime. 'We need lots of protein shakes along with high volumes of red meat, chicken, fish, eggs and nuts, while still  maintaining balance with fruit and vegetables - not to mention the massive intakes of carbohydrates required to power us through the physical work. SAYING GOODBYE TO SLEEP . During the row the women will enter a polyphasic sleep pattern by taking short frequent naps as opposed to the normal monophasic pattern, which is a seven or eight hour block. 'We've done a 48-hour row where we practiced the two-hour on and two-hour off sleep pattern we will be rowing out on the ocean,' says Natalia. 'As long as we can manage to get one full sleep cycle (on average between 45 to 90 minutes) into each shift, we believe the body will have enough time to rest, repair and allow hormonal release as necessary.' And are they testing their exhaustion limits by limiting sleep before the big adventure? 'There's no point,' Natalia said. 'We know we'll be sleep deprived for six months. There's no benefit of being sleep deprived for longer.' The coxless crew (left to right): Isabel Burnham, 30, Emma Mitchell, 29, Laura Penhaul, 31 and Natalia Cohen, 40 all have day jobs and describe themselves as 'ordinary' DEALING WITH STRESS . 'It’s all about recognising what stress feels like for each of us,' Natalia explained. 'What happens to our bodies on a physical and emotional level and how do we behave? 'We will each react differently and while some may be more open, for some of the team we have had to learn how to read each other’s body language to know how they are feeling if they are not vocal about it.' In order to be attuned to each other's behaviours, the women look out for what type of faces they might be pulling, whether they are fidgeting or if there's there something unusual about their behaviour. 'We have practiced coping strategies that draw on  breathing techniques, imagery, music or mantras and mental scripts to help us deal with the stressful situation the most efficiently,' Natalia said. BONDING AS A TEAM . The women didn’t know each other before and have united solely for the purpose of this expedition. 'Through exercises given to us by our sports psychologist Keith Goddard, we have learnt to understand each other’s personality types and why we work in a certain way,' she said. 'We have developed a great team dynamic where we play to each other’s strengths and support development with any weaknesses. 'We do reflections and feedback sessions regularly after an event, so that we can check that we are happy with how everyone is performing and working and that when we receive constructive feedback we don’t take it personally. 'It’s all about learning from situations, ensuring that we continually develop, being effective and having trust in each other and the strength of the team. Natalia Cohen, one of the Coxless Four team at GSK's Human Performance Lab, where the team simulated part of their expedition to assess how many litres is optimal for each of them to drink . The Coxless Four team rowers, Isabel Burnham (far left) and Emma Mitchell (second left) with team-mates Natalia Cohen and Laura Penhaul (top and bottom on rowing machines) STAYING POSITIVE . 'Our minds are the most powerful tool we have to tap into and again and we will need to draw upon our coping strategies and techniques to keep us upbeat and in the moment,' says Natalia. The key, she explains, is to break everything down into manageable sized chunks. 'When we start rowing, we will need to take it stroke by stroke,' she says of getting back on the oars after a two-hour sleep. 'We will undoubtedly have days that are harder than others and I think when one person is having a really bad day, some else may be having an OK one.' KEEPING FOCUSED . Staying focused is a major challenge for the team. 'The second we spot land when coming into Hawaii can be celebrated for a moment but that does not mean that we have arrived,' Natalia said. There could still  challenging days still ahead before they pull into the harbour and the danger of relaxing, is that the team loses focus. 'The way we can overcome this is by ensuring that mentally our end point of each leg is something way beyond just seeing land for the first time. 'We need to project much further than that and have something like the water hitting our face from a shower in our accommodation to signify the end point of each leg. 'That way our focus remains strong and constant through the last few days, the arriving into port, clearing and cleaning Doris and then finally heading to the accommodation for a shower! Only then can we relax and know that we have safely arrived.' The coxless crew ,  are aiming to raise over a quarter of a million pounds for two charities: Walking With the Wounded and Breast Cancer Care survivors . Left to right: Natalia, Isabel, Emma and Laura look forward to reaching labd - but won't allow themselves to get excited until they're in the shower . TAKING THE HEAT . The team had physiological testing with GSK Human Performance Lab to simulate part of their expedition. The women will be rowing across the equator in extreme temperatures  during the six-month odyssey. 'We had salt and lactate testing done while rowing in a temperature controlled chamber in 40 degree heat and 40 per cent humidity so that we know how many litres it is optimal for each of us to drink and how much salt we lose through sweating,'  Natalia said. The team will share the highs and lows of their arduous and epic expedition via a live tracker on their Coxless Crew website and on their Facebook and Twitter pages.

{"question": "The Prince of Wales and Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, ended their second day in the U.S. with a glitzy night out with friends in Washington D.C. The couple, who will celebrate their 10th anniversary next month, put on their best dress for a dinner hosted by Barby Allbritton, the head of the prince's charity in the U.S. and the widow of Joe Allbritton, who owned news stations and the website Politico. The Allbrittons were so close to the British royals that they were two of a few Americans invited to the Royal Wedding between Charles' son Prince William and Kate Middleton in 2011. Charles and Camilla joined Mrs Allbritton, her son Robert - who now runs Politico - and his wife Elena for the black tie charity affair on Wednesday night. The event was so secretive that other guests were only given the address earlier in the day, PageSix reported. Prince Charles and Camila, Duchess of Cornwall, smile outside the a private home on Wednesday where they had dinner.

She is the wife of the late media magnate Joe Allbritton, who owned news stations and the website Politico . The night out came in the middle of the royal couple's four-day trip to the U.S., which is largely being spent in Washington D.C. before a trip to Louisville, Kentucky on Friday. Charles and Camilla still look bright-eyed as they arrived at the party despite a whirlwind day  visiting D.C.'s landmarks and George Washington's plantation before delving into environmental policy. At a meeting of the Global Ocean Commission and the International Sustainability Unit - a charitable group established by the prince to address environmental concerns - Charles spoke about the dangers of accumulating plastic waste in the world's oceans. 'Although the evidence surrounding the links between plastic waste and human health are not yet clear, I would tentatively suggest that they are unlikely to be beneficial,'he said during his 10-minute speech at the Hay Adams hotel. Charles said that he was ‘haunted’ and ‘horrified’ by the issue which needed to be solved for the sake of future generations. Passionate: Following a day of sight-seeing on Wednesday, Prince Charles also attended an environmental event at the Hay Adams hotel, where he gave a 10-minute speech on the importance of recycling . Meeting the King: Charles and Camilla arrive at the Martin Luther King Memorial in Washington DC, where they were met by Congresswoman Terri Sewel, left, and civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, right . Making friends: The royal couple drew a crowd as they arrived at the Memorial on Tuesday . Fans: Members of the public, including a middle school history class, snap photos of the royal couple . ‘Speaking as a grandfather with a new grandchild due to appear in this world in a month’s time, I think we probably owe it to everyone else’s grandchildren to grasp that solution,’ he said. His impassioned speech came after he and his wife took time out to play tourists. On Wednesday morning, the couple wrapped up against the brisk temperatures for their 20-minute tour of the Martin Luther King memorial and paused to read his quotations engraved in the stone. 'Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that,' read one quotation where the royal couple paused to see King's words from 1963. Harry Johnson, the president of the foundation that built the King memorial, said he gave the royal couple a stone from the memorial's granite as a gift. The couple then visited the Lincoln Memorial, where they were greeted by historians. Towering: The royals posed in front of the memorials with members of congress and civil rights leaders . Paying their respects: Charles and Camilla speak with Ed Jackson during their tour of the memorial . Taking the tour: Camilla, who was chic in a grey coat, was shown around by Congresswoman Terri Sewel . During the visit, they were happy to chat with students on field trips. Joan Darby, who brought her U.S. history class from Stafford, Virginia, to the King memorial said they were thrilled to meet Charles and Camilla, along with civil rights leaders Rev. Jesse Jackson and Rep. John Lewis. 'To come here and have such a joyful event was just really incredible luck on our part,' she said. Camilla, who was showing off a chic new hairstyle, obligingly stopped for a selfie before continuing on with U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell by her side. Charles and Camilla were then whisked off to Mount Vernon, where they were met by the Governor and First Lady of Virginia, Terry and Dorothy McAuliffe. One of the most historic spots in the US, parts of the estate have been in the Washington family since the mid-17th century and it was at Mount Vernon that George Washington, the first president of the United States, lived.

The document, a successor to the original 1209 charter, was reissued by Edward I as a quid pro quo for extra funds with which to wage war on Scotland. It was also on a tour of the National Archives that Charles learned his uncle once developed a new polo stick.  National Archivist David Ferriero presented the prince with a patent application submitted in 1931 by his uncle, Lord Louis Mountbatten, for a new kind of polo stick. Charles, himself a polo player, laughed and said he had no idea that his uncle had designed a polo stick. He also laughed when shown a telegram from the U.S. embassy in London to the Secretary of State, sent in 1957 seeking instructions to ensure that a toy car that had been given to Charles, then 8 years old, would be working properly when he returned home to play with it. Camilla, meanwhile, visited the Shakespeare Theatre Company. During an afternoon visit to the National Archives, Prince Charles laughs as he's shown a telegram from the American Embassy in London to the U.S. Secretary of State in 1957, asking for instructions on how to operate a toy car that was to be gifted to the then 8-year-old prince .

{"question": "(CNN)The news was stunning to hear: A young woman, 18-year-old Michelle Carter, was charged with involuntary manslaughter for allegedly sending text messages urging her friend to commit suicide. How could a young person -- who was a close friend of the deceased, Conrad Roy, 18 -- allegedly do such a horrifying thing? And what are the legal ramifications of what a teen says online or in a text? But a lesser discussed point this tragic story raises is how quickly a teen can go from normal everyday life to facing severe, life-altering legal consequences. That is why Lisa Green, author of the informative new book \"On Your Case: A Compassionate (and Only Slightly Bossy) Legal Guide for Every Stage of a Woman's Life,\" believes every parent of a teen should have a criminal defense lawyer in mind and at the ready -- just in case. \"To me this is the unrecognized area that parents, particularly parents of teens, miss all the time,\" said Green during a recent interview at CNN's studios. \"So many of our friends have armies of tutors, extracurricular activities, all sorts of angles covered ... but when it comes to the law, there's this black hole.\" Mom arrested for leaving 9-year-old alone at park . Green, a journalist, lawyer and television legal analyst, says people often think of  the law as scary and intimidating and believe they don't need to worry about it because their kid is never going to get into legal trouble. Whether it's a case as serious as Carter's involuntary manslaughter charge, or a simple allegation of vandalism, parents need to be prepared, Green said. \"I cannot count the number of kids I know, good kids, who find themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time,\" said Green. \"I have now two young adults, and when they were going through their teenage years, it was a simple matter of a party that went wrong, a group of kids in the park when the police stop by and have some questions, bringing something to school they shouldn't have. \"And in each of those cases, a little bit of knowledge of the law, a little bit of knowledge of what their rights are, the right way to behave, would have saved parents a heck of a lot of grief.\" Green thinks parents should think about the issue in the same way they would track down a good orthopedist if their child breaks a bone, or the best tutor if their child is struggling before the SAT. Parents' house seized after son's drug bust . \"I am not saying that parents need to go out and get their own law degrees ... but just dipping your finger into the topic will help you understand what's available to you to help you parent better,\" she said. She gives some real-life examples especially in the social media age. For instance, what if a teen is asked by a school administrator to turn over his or her cell phone based on allegations the teen was sending inappropriate texts? What parents should know, Green said, is that a school can't open a cell phone for no reason at all. \"They need to have reasonable suspicion that something's wrong,\" said Green, who said parents would be wise to talk to their teens about what's appropriate and what's not when it comes to handling such requests from school officials. \"If you're asked, as a child, for a locker search, to open a phone, to open a laptop, if it's your property, pause and ask if you could call Mom and Dad,\" she said. \"We can act whether we're lawyers or not as that first line of defense.\" Green also says that parents of college-bound teens should spend a few minutes looking online at the school's code of conduct. \"They don't tell you about it during that fantastic tour with the kid walking backwards as your child is looking around to say, 'Who can I party with?' But it's a really important set of information because different schools have different levels of tolerance\" for activities such as drinking on campus, she said. And even before teens head off to college, parents should know about social host laws, where parents could be held criminally responsible or face civil damages if teens drink alcohol in their home and then go off and do something inappropriate or even tragic. Scary consequences for parents hosting underage drinking . More than 150 cities or counties and 24 states currently have such laws on their books, according to Mothers Against Drunk Driving. In some cases, parents can be held liable even if they didn't know the drinking was taking place. \"It doesn't have to be you with the shaker, like an episode of 'Mad Men,' serving up Manhattans to a group of grateful teens,\" said Green. \"If you've made it possible in your home, if you don't lock your liquor cabinet -- I never did -- and all of a sudden kids are drinking, that could be a problem as well.\" While Green is passionate about educating parents on why they need to think about the law, she stresses that bad behavior by teens still needs to be punished either legally or at home. \"I am not advocating that kids should be absolved of responsibility. If a kid does something wrong, if they broke the law, they ought to be punished appropriately by it. But we also live in a society where we have legal rights, and I want parents to know that they should be aware of what those are so they can help their child use better judgment.\" So if after reading this, you are moved to try to find a criminal defense lawyer, how on earth do you go about finding one? Green's advice is to ask friends and colleagues for referrals and also consult with your state bar association, since you would want someone in your state who has experience with criminal defense issues. Then she says you should call up and interview a few lawyers, asking them everything from how much their services would cost (that can vary), to who would handle the work, to what their philosophy is about the law and teens' rights. \"You may or may not end up being friends afterwards, but that's not as important as feeling secure that your lawyer is approaching the situation in a way that feels right for you.\" Do you think it's important for parents of teens to be aware of the law and their children's legal rights? Share your thoughts with Kelly Wallace (@kellywallacetv) on Twitter or CNN Living on Facebook.", "answer": ["Parents of teens should have a criminal defense lawyer in mind -- just in case, says author .\nAuthor Lisa Green calls this the \"unrecognized area\"  that parents of teens \"miss all the time\"\nIn 24 states, parents can be held liable for teen drinking in their home ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "Porto right-back Danilo admits he is proud to be linked with Real Madrid, as the European champions step up their interest in the Brazilian right-back. Although he insists he is fully focused on his current club, Danilo is 'ready' to sit down at the end of the season and discuss his future. 'I'm living a great moment with Porto,' he told Spanish newspaper AS. 'It makes me happy a great club like Madrid is interested in me. Danilo is currently on international duty with Brazil, and admits he is flattered by interest from Real Madrid . AS leads on Danilo's potential move to Madrid, while Mundo Deportivo focus on Gerard 'Piquembauer' Pique . 'When the season ends I'll sit down with Porto and we'll decide what is best for me and them.' The 23-year-old is currently on international duty with Brazil, alongside current Real Madrid defender Marcelo, who is likely to have an impact on Danilo's decision come the end of the season. AS report that it will cost Madrid €30million (£22m) to bring Danilo to the Bernabeu. Elsewhere in Spain, Mundo Deportivo's front page leads on Gerard Pique, and his comparison to Bayern Munich and Germany legend Franz Beckenbauer. Pique has made the centre-back position his own and is now Barcelona's leader at the heart of defence . Beckenbauer is widely regarded as one of the best defenders ever to have lived, and the Spanish paper have dubbed Pique 'Piquembauer' on their front page. 'The comeback', reads the headline, as Mundo claim Pique has taken on the challenge and is once again a world-class performer in his position. The 28-year-old has made 31 appearances in a Barcelona shirt so far this season, and has confirmed his inheritance of the leadership from Puyol at the Nou Camp, 'gaining weight' in the dressing room in the process. Marcello Lippi thinks Juventus can win the Champions League (left) while Michel Platini also has kind words . In Italy, La Gazzetta dello Sport carry an interview with Marcello Lippi, two-time Juventus manager and World Cup-winning coach with Italy. He claims he can see himself in Massimiliano Allegri, the current Juve manager, and has backed him to win the Champions League this season. Lippi was in charge of the Italy team that won the World Cup in 2006 despite being underdogs in Germany, and thinks Juve's situation in Europe is similar. 'In the Champions League he can do like Italy in 2006,' Lippi told La Gazzetta. 'We weren't favourites, but we won.

{"question": "A 66-year-old man told his wife that he feared hospital staff were 'trying to kill him' a day before they put him on a 'do not resuscitate' notice without the consent of his family, an inquest has heard. Michael Richardson, from Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, died at James Paget University Hospital in Gorleston-on-Sea, Norfolk,  after medics 'played God' with his life, his widow said. The great-grandfather, who died in October 2013, had been ill for several years with a lung condition which caused his breathing to stop but had been given more than a year to live. Heartbroken: Michael Richardson died at James Paget University Hospital after medics 'played God' with his life, his widow, Janet (pictured with her late husband) said told an inquest today. Right, Mr Richardson . Giving evidence at an inquest, his widow, Janet, said her husband had tried to discharge himself the day before his death after becoming concerned about the levels of oxygen he was being given. Speaking at the inquest in Norfolk, she said: 'He said, \"I can't breathe, take me home - I can't stand it any more. They're trying to kill me\". 'I said, \"I love you\", and then he said he loved me too. That was the last time I saw him alive. 'I wish I'd bundled him up and taken him home because at least if he was going to die, he was going to die with some dignity.' The 66-year-old accused medics of playing God with his life after discovering a do not resuscitate (DNR) notice had been placed on him without the consent of the family. The inquest heard the family, who had recently moved to Norfolk from Deal, Kent, only learned of the notice when they picked up Mr Richardson's death certificate from the hospital four days after he died. Janet Richardson (centre, with a photo of Mr Richardson) with daughters Jocelin Taylor (left) and Antonia Richardson (right). The widow claimed she only learned of the DNR order four days after her husband's death . Asked by assistant coroner David Osborne if she had given consent for this, Mrs Richardson said: 'No, nothing at all.' She added: 'I visited the hospital twice a day.  There would have been loads of opportunities for staff to talk to me. If he had been asked about the DNR notice, he would have said no, I know that. 'He used to say, \"some life is better than no life, you're a long time dead\". He was well aware he would die at some point, just not that quickly.' Mr Richardson, who was born in Islington, London, was diagnosed with the lung-scarring condition pulmonary fibrosis  in 2008 and received oxygen therapy at home. On October 24 2013, his condition deteriorated and his family called an ambulance which took him to the hospital. Mrs Richardson said he had been moved between various wards and when she visited him he 'seemed worse than when he went in'. Although his medical notes correctly identified pulmonary fibrosis as his main condition, he was initially treated for emphysema, Mrs Richardson said. When she pointed this out, doctors increased his oxygen levels. She also described how her husband had been left to lie on soiled sheets and was not being regularly washed. Care: Mrs Richardson accused medics at James Paget University Hospital of playing God with his life after discovering a do not resuscitate (DNR) notice had been placed on him without the consent of the family . Nurse Louise Curtis described how staff had initially rushed to resuscitate Mr Richardson after an emergency alarm was activated. But as they tried to save his life, a colleague checked his notes and pointed out the DNR notice so they stopped these efforts. She added that staffing levels that day had been 'unusually low' with herself and two agency nurses responsible for 27 patients. Normally the ward would have been staffed by four or five nurses.", "answer": ["Michael Richardson, 66, died at James Paget University Hospital in 2013 .\nHe had been ill for five years but had been given more than a year to live .\nHe tried to discharge himself day before his death, his widow told inquest .\nShe said he'd raised concerns over amount of oxygen he was being given .\nFour days after his death, Mrs Richardson found out about DNR notice .\nShe said family had not consented and accused medics of playing God .\nNurse on-duty at the time today described staff levels as 'unusually low'"], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "Sepp Blatter celebrated his 79th birthday on Tuesday as one of his rivals for the FIFA presidency obtained some high-level support for his bid to be the most powerful person in world football. Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein of Jordan has secured statements of support from the King of Bahrain and Prince Sufri Bolkiah, a senior member of the Brunei royal family. Although neither of the royals will have a vote at the election on May 29 there is a history, particularly in Arab countries, of the ruling family influencing football policy. FIFA Vice President Prince Ali bin al-Hussein is in the running to become the next president of FIFA . The Prince sits alongside UEFA President Michel Platini during a CONMEBOL congress on March 4 . That could be important to Prince Ali who has struggled to win support in his own Asian football confederation (AFC) - only one AFC country, his home country Jordan, nominated him to stand. It is by no means certain however that the Bahrain FA will back Prince Ali despite the King offering his support. AFC president Sheikh Salman Bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa is also from Bahrain and has already given his backing to Blatter. Furthermore, the leading powerbroker in Olympic sport Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah from Kuwait is also supporting Blatter. Ali bin al-Hussein has received backing from high profile supporters, including the King of Bahrain (above), . Sheikh Ahmad wields significant influence, especially in Asia as head of the Olympic Council of Asia, and is himself standing for the FIFA executive committee at the end of April. Prince Ali is understood to be buoyed by the royal backing, and also to have taken heart from last week's congress of the South American confederation CONMEBOL, where no formal vote to back Blatter was taken. A report from Jordan's government new agency stated: 'His Majesty King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalif of Bahrain, on Monday, received HRH Prince Ali bin Al-Hussein accompanied by Interior Minister Hussein Majali, and stressed Bahrain's support to Prince Ali's bid for FIFA presidency.' Blatter has three challengers for the presidency: Prince Ali, Dutch FA president Michael van Praag and former Portugal international Luis Figo. Despite being heavily criticised during his reign, Sepp Blatter wants the presidency for a fourth term . Luis Figo (left) and Michael van Praag are the two remaining candidates in the presidential race . Last week van Praag said there would be a better chance of victory if there was only one candidate from Europe. He also claimed Figo's plans for funding national associations would 'bankrupt FIFA'. Meanwhile, Germany's outgoing FIFA member Theo Zwanziger has reiterated his belief that the 2022 World Cup should be removed from Qatar if the Garcia report into bidding for the tournament flags up rule breaches. Zwanziger told Bayern 2 radio station: 'The best solution would be not to play in Qatar and to rectify this wrong decision. But that can only happen if the report provides sufficient clues that the awarding broke FIFA ethics rules.'", "answer": ["Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein is one of several candidates bidding to replace Sepp Blatter as president of world football's governing body .\nHe has received support from the King of Bahrain and Prince Sufri Bolkiah of Brunei who have a history of influencing football policy .\nLuis Figo and Michael van Praag are the remaining candidates in the race ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "Even if all it amounts to is a handful of visits to England's training camp to spend a few hours observing the players and offering some pointers, the prospect of Jonny Wilkinson being involved with the national team is an enticing one. Nothing is certain at this stage, but it is not out of the question that the iconic fly-half will agree to give his input as Stuart Lancaster's squad prepare for the World Cup. If the 35-year-old hero of the 2003 triumph does take on a role of sorts — and that would appear to be a big if — it wouldn't be as a coach and it might not even amount to a consultancy, certainly not on a regular basis. Jonny Wilkinson could lend his expertise to England's 2015 rugby World Cup preperations . Wilkinson, who was a fly-half, kicked the winning drop goal to lead England to World Cup glory in 2003 . Wilkinson has been getting involved with rugby coaching and could aid England's World Cup preparations . England coach Stuart Lancaster would not ignore the opportunity to use Wilkinson's know-how . But most England supporters would settle for Wilkinson popping into the HQ in Surrey on his way to the supermarket, if there was any chance of some of that stardust and winner's mentality rubbing off on the class of 2015. It is all about the aura. Here is a man who was once the nation's sporting darling, while in rugby circles he is treated with a mixture of respect and awe. In the south of France, where he worked wonders for Toulon in the closing years of his career, he is adored. When false rumours surfaced at the start of the year that he was destined for a knighthood, they were assumed to be correct. Such an honour would have surprised no one. The current generation of England players grew up admiring his epic deeds. The fly-halves in particular — George Ford, Owen Farrell and Danny Cipriani — could learn so much from the maestro. Stuart Lancaster has an established coaching group and there are no plans to expand it, for now. At present, Mike Catt works with the kickers in camp, while another RFU coach, Jon Callard, has also spent time with them, though less so recently. Ford has private sessions with Wilkinson's kicking mentor, the renowned Dave Alred, who has not had a role in the national set-up since the last World Cup. But any chance to tap into the know-how of one of the country's all-time greats, with his legendary work ethic and meticulous approach, would not be casually ignored by Lancaster. Wilkinson has spoken of his interest in the option of working as a specialist coach or tutor, and has done so part-time with Toulon this season. Wilkinson (centre) is revered in Toulon, where he spent the final years of his career as a player . Lancaster already has one 2003 World Cup winner in his coaching ranks in Mike Catt (centre) Wilkinson's input could help England's current fly-halfs such as George Ford . Danny Cipriani (left) and Owen Farrell are England's other alternatives at fly-half . For all his personal accomplishments, he is wise enough to accept that playing pedigree does not necessarily translate into coaching credentials. Talking last autumn, after being invited into England's camp, he said: 'If there is anything I can add, then we can have a little chat, but more importantly I need to learn my trade. I was a player, but just because I knew how to play doesn't mean I've earned the right to tell other people how to do it. 'I'm coaching one week every month in Toulon, learning my way around it. I'm coaching individual skills, mentoring some of the young guys on how to cope with the emotional and mental side of things. I'm really enjoying it, but the biggest mistake you can make is thinking just because you played the game, you already know it.' As a recent retiree who keeps himself supremely fit, Wilkinson could comfortably take on an active role, demonstrating the points he makes. In fact, it would not be a leap of the mind to imagine him matching England's current kickers shot for shot in extended practice sessions. While there is scope to improve the kicking game, both at goal and tactical, Wilkinson is a big admirer of the men currently country's vying for his old shirt. Wilkinson (left) acknowledges that success as a player offers no guarantees to becoming a skilled coach . Lancaster (left) and his England side narrowly missed out on Six Nations glory on Saturday . Wilkinson speaks highly of the abilities of England's current fly-halfs, especially Ford and Farrell . 'George Ford is a fabulous player who produces some amazing touches and is an absolute natural in the way he reads the game,' he said. 'He works hard, wants to improve and as a young guy he is happy to take on responsibility and shows he can deal with it. That makes him a great person to have in that position. 'Owen Farrell is immensely mentally tough and deserves a hell of a lot more credit than he has been getting for what he has done in the last few years. As a young guy, he has said, 'Here is pressure, I will deal with it. Not only that, I will kick your goals for you and stand up in defence and bring this team together'. That is brilliant.' That talented pair would speak highly of their acclaimed predecessor too. It could be a perfect fit. England have the biggest representation on a 12-strong list for the RBS 6 Nations player of the tournament. Jonathan Joseph, George Ford, Ben Youngs and Billy Vunipola feature alongside Ireland's Paul O'Connell, Robbie Henshaw and Conor Murray, Welshmen Alun Wyn Jones and Dan Biggar, Scots Stuart Hogg and Jonny Gray, and Italy captain Sergio Parisse.", "answer": ["Jonny Wilkinson could help England's 2015 World Cup preparations .\nWilkinson has been learning to coach part-time with Toulon this season .\nWilkinson was a World Cup winner with England in 2003 ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "China has been rocked by a hard-hitting film made by a former state TV news anchor which links her baby's tumour to the country's terrible air pollution. Chai Jing's investigative documentary - which has already attracted unprecedented attention from the country's officials - explores the controversial topic of smog in China, one of the most widespread issues in the state. In the opening scene of the documentary, Ms Chai tells the story of her daughter, who was diagnosed with a benign tumour before her birth in October 2013. The 39-year-old goes on to report how a number of newborn babies in China have contracted pneumonia without even leaving home. Scroll down for video . Young victims: Chai Jing, 39, has made a hard-hitting film, exploring the controversial topic of smog in China, one of the most widespread issues in the state . Motherly love: In the opening scene of the documentary, Ms Chai tells how her daughter was diagnosed with a benign tumour before her birth in October 2013 . The film also features an interview with Wang Huiqin (pictured), 6, who lives in highly industrialised Shanxi Province and says she has never seen stars or blue skies . Although Ms Chai does not explicitly link her daughter's tumour to China's air pollution, the film - the first to probe the topic in such depth - has prompted public speculation that the two are connected. It has already been watched by some 200million people and has sparked a firestorm of public criticism over the government's failure to act on the issue in a timely manner. In the 144-minute film, Ms Chai, a former anchor at China Central Television, the Communist Party's mouthpiece, tells how she made the documentary to tell her daughter 'what is smog, where smog comes from and what we shall do with it'. She explains how she found herself pregnant in January 2013, when 25 provinces and cities in China were blanketed by heavy smog. She then gave birth in October 2013, when her daughter had already been diagnosed with a benign tumour. The diagnosis led to Ms Chai quitting her job  at the beginning of last year so she could focus on taking care of her daughter. It was during that period that she began making the film, entitled Under the Dome, she explains. Enveloped: Most cities in China, such as Beijing and Shanghai (pictured), face serious air pollution issues . Price for industrialisation: China burns a large amount of petroleum and coal, two major causes of pollution . The film was distributed to various video websites in China on February 28. It received 117 million views in the first 24 hours, according to Tencent. Ms Chai's daughter is no longer unwell. But she says in the film that she only took her daughter outside when air quality in Beijing was marked excellent or good. The rest of the time she had to lock her daughter at home 'like a prisoner', she claims. She adds that 175 days during 2014 were graded as polluted in Beijing. The film also includes an interview with a six-year-old girl, Wang Huiqin, who lives in Shanxi Province, a heavily industrialised area in central China. The girl tells Ms Chai in the interview how she has never seen stars, blue skies or white clouds in her life. Stardom: Ms Chai is a highly recognised anchor and investigative journalist in China. She is also a best-selling writer . Controversy: Although Ms Chai does not explicitly link her daughter's tumour to China's air pollution, the film - the first to probe the topic in such depth - has prompted public speculation that the two are connected . China's cities are often hit by heavy pollution – in the form of smog – caused by burning a large amount of petroleum and coal. The film has already been widely backed by the Chinese public, as well as a number of officials. Chen Jining, the newly appointed minister of environmental protection in China, was quoted in an article on People's Daily as saying: 'I want to thank her. She has wakened up the public to pay attention to the environment from a public health perspective. 'I think (she is) worth our respect.'

{"question": "It's the run of games which will go a long way to deciding whether Manchester United are playing Champions League or Europa League football next season. Four of the Premier League's top six - Tottenham, Liverpool, Manchester City and Chelsea - in their next fives games. Make-or-break for Louis van Gaal and his players. Other than the home clash with relegation-threatened Aston Villa on April 4, Sunday's visit of Spurs would appear to be United's best hope of three points over the next month and a half. But recent results tell a different story. Marouane Fellaini, Michael Carrick and Wayne Rooney (L-R) look dejected during defeat by Arsenal . Christian Eriksen scores Tottenham's winning goal against Manchester United at Old Trafford last season . Eriksen is mobbed by his team-mates after helping Tottenham to their second consecutive win at Old Trafford . 29.09.2012 - Manchester United 2-3 Tottenham . 20.01.2013 - Tottenham 1-1 Manchester United . 01.12.2013 - Tottenham 2-2 Manchester United . 01.01.2014 - Manchester United 1-2 Tottenham . 28.12.2014 - Tottenham 0-0 Manchester United . Having won 17 and drawn five of their previous 22 games against Tottenham, United now find themselves without a win in their last five matches with the north London outfit. Mauricio Pochettino's men battled to a 0-0 at White Hart Lane in December but Spurs have won their previous two visits to Old Trafford, ending a 23-year wait for victory with a 3-2 triumph in September 2012. United had gone 26 games without defeat at home to Spurs in all competitions - winning their previous nine - before a Jonny Evans own goal and strikes from Gareth Bale and Clint Dempsey gave Andre Villas-Boas' men a memorable win in Manchester. And Tottenham proved that result was no fluke last season when goals from Emmanuel Adebayor and Christian Eriksen sealed a 2-1 victory for Tim Sherwood's side. Gareth Bale scores during Tottenham's 3-2 victory at Old Trafford in September 2012 - their first in 23 years . Clint Dempsey celebrates after netting Spurs' winner against Sir Alex Ferguson's side . Then Tottenham manager Andre Villas-Boas shows his delight after the final whistle . Two draws at White Hart Lane - 1-1 in January 2013 and 2-2 in December 2013 - were sandwiched between those victories, taking Spurs' unbeaten run to an impressive five games. So impressive, in fact, that they are only the third team to manage such a run against United. Liverpool did the same between 2000 and 2002, winning four consecutive games against their great rivals - including two at Old Trafford - and drawing once. Blackburn Rovers also went five games unbeaten against the Red Devils between 2004 and 2006, winning at Old Trafford in September 2005 and coming out on top in two fixtures at Ewood Park. Just three points behind United going into Sunday's game, Tottenham have a major incentive to pull off their third successive win at Old Trafford and become the first team to go six games unbeaten against United in the Premier League era.

{"question": "A startling video has emerged showing an officer putting his hand around a woman's throat then forcing her to the floor at a Massachusetts police station. The footage, taken in February 2013, was released this week following a $1 million federal lawsuit filed by the woman, Maylene Maldonado, against the Chicopee police officer, Daniel Major. Major has resigned from the department, WCVB reported. The footage shows him and two other officers restraining Maldonado, who was arrested for allegedly slapping a police officer after she admitted to drinking and smoking PCP, Mlive reported. In the video, the then-24-year-old repeatedly tells the officers that her lip ring is giving her pain and asks them to help her remove it. Arrest: Maylene Maldonado can be seen screaming as she is taken into custody in February 2013 . Attack: One of the officers, Sergeant Daniel Major, then abruptly grabs her neck and holds on . But as she continues to scream, Major suddenly grabs her around the neck and continues to hold on as his fellow officers do nothing. Then they all pull the woman to the ground. While on the floor, Major shouts: 'Shut the f*** up!' Maldonado was charged with resisting arrest and assault and battery on a police officer. In her lawsuit, which also names the other officers, Maldonado has accused the officers of assault and battery and civil rights violations, and accuses the city of failing to properly train its officers. She also claims she never received medical treatment for the injuries she allegedly sustained. Maldonado, from Springfield, was arrested after her friend's car got stuck in a snowbank in Chicopee and officers, who were called to the area following reports about a man with a knife, saw her running to a nearby gas station and went to check on her. She admitted to drinking and smoking the hallucinogenic drug PCP and then got into an altercation with police officers when they tried to see her license. Holding on: She struggles as Major holds on to her neck - while the other officers stand back and do nothing . 'Attack': The officers then push Maldonado to the ground, where Major says: 'Shut the f*** up' She slapped an officer across the face and apologized, according to the criminal complaint, but was arrested and taken to the police station where the alleged assault unfolded. The case has also caused divisions within the department. Thomas Charette, the acting chief at the time of the 2013 incident, defended Major's actions as appropriate because Maldonado was high on PCP and allegedly spat blood during her arrest. 'Sergeant Major made several attempts to speak softly and calmly with Ms. Maldonado in order to calm her and complete the booking process,' Charette said, according to WHDH. 'However, she was either unwilling or unable to understand simple instructions and kept insisting that Sergeant Major repeat himself.' An internal police review determined he had 'acted admirably', Mlive reported, and a clerk-magistrate's hearing agreed. A district court judge  reviewed the recording and he was charged with assault and battery in November 2013. Major, in court in November 2013, was charged with assault but an internal review found he did nothing wrong, which the current police chief has disputed. Major has since retired but now faces a lawsuit from the woman . But because internal affairs investigation found no wrongdoing, former Chicopee Mayor Michael Bissonette told ABC40 that his hands were tied. Despite his predecessor's ruling, the current chief, William Jebb, has said Major did not act appropriately and handed the video over to City Hall officials, Mlive.com reported. 'We want to make it clear, it's a different administration,' Chicopee Police Officer Mike Wilk told ABC. 'Two officers have retired and a lot of people have asked about releasing it. Chief Jebb and (Mayor) Kos want it to be transparent department. That's why we released it today.' Charette ultimately retired in July 2014 after Jebb beat him to secure the job of police chief. Mayor Richard Kos' office said: 'The city takes these allegations very seriously and the Chicopee Law Department will file a timely answer to this lawsuit once served.'", "answer": ["Maylene Maldonado was arrested in Chicopee, Massachusetts in February 2013 after slapping a police officer and admitting to taking drugs .\nAs she was being booked, she screamed at officers that she was in pain and one suddenly grabbed her by the throat and pushed her to the floor .\nThe other officers stood back and did nothing .\nOfficer Daniel Major was accused of assault but an internal investigation found he did nothing wrong - which the new police chief disputes .\nMaldonado has now filed a $1m lawsuit against Major, other officers and the city and police shared the never-before-released video this week ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "Mr Xie, a teacher in China, has been sacked after punishing two students by making them kneel on the floor and act as his footstool (above) A teacher in China has been sacked after punishing two students by making them kneel on the floor and act as footstools. Mr Xie told the male pupils from Nanguang High School in Fujian to stay behind after class on Thursday because they were being too loud. He made the students crouch on the floor while he played on his phone and put his bare feet on their backs, People's Daily Online reported. Mr Xie, who has been a teacher for 27 years, was dismissed after the Nan'an City Education Department saw a picture on social media. The image shows both students being made to kneel on the ground in their school uniforms in front of a crowd of pupils. Mr Liu, headteacher, said Mr Xie, who is in his 40s, was supervising a small self-study group around 7.30pm when the two students were too noisy. The Year One pupils - thought to be aged between six and seven - were taken into a different room and told to kneel on the ground. Mr Liu said the footstool photo was taken as a joke and added that Mr Xie, who was in charge of disciplining the male students at the school, 'performed well in his work and was extremely talented'. Nan'an City Department of Education said it took immediate action. It requested the school apologise to students and parents, and said that student counselling should also be offered. Stronger ethics and appropriate styles of teaching would be implemented at the school, the department added. Mr Liu said that a school representative had already gone to the homes of the two students to apologise formally.

{"question": "Bryan Robson has paid Chris Smalling a huge compliment by likening his recent performances to those of Paul McGrath and Gary Pallister. Five years after signing for United, Smalling is yet to convince many United fans he and Phil Jones are suitable long-term replacements for Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand, who left Old Trafford last summer after long and distinguished careers. The 25-year-old has been the object of a few taunts, most recently in the Manchester derby last November when he was sent off in the 39th minute. Manchester United defender Chris Smalling (centre) has impressed Bryan Robson in recent weeks . Robson believes Smalling's passing has been 'crisper' during his displays against Arsenal and Newcastle . Smalling, already on a booking, showed a complete lack of composure by hacking down James Milner in the corner to earn his second yellow and United went on to lose 1-0 against a City team that was there for the taking. Smalling has since shown signs of improvement, though. His commanding performance in last week's 3-0 victory over Tottenham caught Robson's eye and the former United captain thinks that bodes well for Louis van Gaal ahead of Sunday's trip to Anfield. Robson said: 'Chris is a good defender. I have seen him improve over the last few games. 'I even thought against Arsenal and Newcastle away, his passing was a lot better, a lot crisper, so he has come on to a good game, he is in good form at the moment and that will be important at Liverpool.' Smalling kept 26-goal striker Harry Kane quiet last Sunday and the former Fulham man ventured forward, striding confidently with the ball at his feet on a few occasions. The end product was not good enough to suggest Van Gaal has a new Beckenbauer in his squad just yet, but Robson was so impressed by Smalling's confidence that he felt moved to liken the centre-back to two United greats in Pallister and McGrath. Smalling kept a close eye on Tottenham striker Harry Kane during Manchester United's win against Spurs . The former lifted 10 trophies at United and the latter would have won much more than the 1985 FA Cup had he not fought a long-running battle with alcoholism which eventually cost him his place at the club. 'Paul McGrath could do that and so could Gary Pallister,' Robson said when invited to liken Smalling's display to a figure from the past. 'When you keep possession at the back sometimes it's really important that your defenders break past the forwards and they get into the midfield area. 'That means one of your midfield players should be able to get space and I thought Chris did that particularly well against Tottenham and that made it difficult for the Tottenham players.' Smalling seemed pleased to be compared to two defensive stalwarts of the Sir Alex Ferguson era. Robson has compared Smalling to former Manchester United defender McGrath . Smalling has also been compared with Gary Pallister (left, pictured with Peter Schmeichel in 1996) 'It's a great feeling know that people are taking notice,' Smalling said. 'I am just hoping I can keep it up and keep a good run and contribute to our results.' Smalling will have to be at his very best again on Sunday at Anfield. Van Gaal has warned the centre-back - and the rest of his team-mates - they must not get sent off in this volatile fixture. As well as pride and bragging rights, a place in the top four is at stake. Liverpool have not lost since they fell 3-0 at Old Trafford in December and a victory for the hosts would move them above United into fourth for the first time since August. Robson thinks victory against Liverpool would deliver a significant blow to the Reds' top-four hopes and is not ruling out a second-place finish for United, who trail City by just two points after their loss at Burnley last weekend. 'Yes, (second) is a realistic target,' the former United captain said. 'We have to play City and Arsenal at home and if we beat both of them all of a sudden your points tally is looking really good. 'When you talk about the top teams it seems as if you look at it like you are going to get beat all the time and the lads have proven that they can perform really well against a top team like Tottenham. 'And a win at Liverpool at this stage of the season would be a fantastic result for us.'

{"question": "Scared for her life: Model Anna Duritskaya, 23, is under police protection in Ukraine after reporting a 'threat to her life from unidentified individuals' Ukraine has put the girlfriend of slain Russian opposition politician Boris Nemtsov under state protection after she received death threats. Model Anna Duritskaya, 23, is now under the guard of SBU secret services and the police. Kiev also said today that she would not return to Moscow over the probe into the death of the Vladimir Putin foe. 'We will not let her go back to Russia,' said Anton Geraschenko, an aide to the Interior Minister. 'If Russian investigators need to talk to her, they will have to come to Ukraine.' The announcement came as another of Russia's leading opposition figures vowed that he and his supporters will not be intimidated by as he walked free from a 15-day spell in jail. Alexei Navalny, who had been convicted of handing out leaflets calling for an opposition rally, said he would continue his staunch criticism of Vladimir Putin's government despite the Mr Nemtsov's murder seven days ago. Emerging unshaven from a Moscow detention centre this morning, Mr Navalny said: 'This act of terror hasn't achieved its goal, it will not frighten me or my comrades. We will not reduce our efforts, we will not step back.' A key figure in Boris Yeltsin's 1990s government, Mr Nemtsov was the most prominent figure in Russia's liberal opposition to be killed during President Vladimir Putin's 15-year rule. The 55-year-old was shot four times in the back by a gunman in a passing car as he walked hand-in-hand with Miss Duritskaya on a bridge across the Moskva River on Friday night, in the shadow of central Moscow's St Basil Cathedral. The Ukrainian woman - physically unhurt in the attack - revealed the death threats to police in Kiev, who said today they were providing her with protection. 'On March 5, Anna Duritskaya, who is a witness in the case in the murder of Russian opposition politician Boris Nemtsov, turned to the Ukrainian police in the Kiev Region with a statement on a threat to her life from unidentified individuals,' said the prosecutor-general's office in Ukraine. The statement offered no information on who might have issued the threats, according to the Associated Press. The model was staying with her parents since returning to her home country. A relative in Ukraine said she was 'in a bad mental state'. In the aftermath of Mr Nemtsov's assassination, Miss Duritskaya was repeatedly questioned by Russian investigators, and she complained that she was held under armed guard and unable to leave the country. However, she returned to Ukraine last week. 'This act of terror will not frighten me or my comrades': Opposition leader Alexei Navalny said he would continue his staunch criticism of Vladimir Putin's government despite the Mr Nemtsov's murder . Gunned down: Boris Nemtsov, 55, (left) and 23-year-old Miss Duritskaya (right) were walking hand-in-hand through Moscow after having dinner on Friday night when he was shot four times in the back . As thousands gathered in Moscow to pay their last respects at Mr Nemtsov's funeral, Putin insisted the Russian law enforcement authorities would do 'everything' to solve the crime. However, Nemtsov's eldest child, Zhanna Nemtsova, 30, revealed that investigators had not spoken to a single member of his close family six days after the murder. They believe his 'cruel and barefaced murder' was because of his political opposition to the Kremlin. Yesterday a top Nato official suggested Putin was responsible for Mr Nemtsov's death as he accused the Russian president of silencing dissent at home while seeking to turn Ukraine into a failed state. 'We've seen that the victims are not just in eastern Ukraine, with the brutal murder of Boris Nemtsov last Friday,' NATO Deputy Secretary General Alexander Vershbow said. Speaking to members of parliament from EU countries at a conference in Riga, Mr Vershbow went on: 'While we don't know who pulled the trigger, we do know that Boris Nemtsov was a powerful voice for democracy and against Russia's involvement in Ukraine ... (and) was among those vilified as \"traitors\" and \"fifth columnists\" in Russia's official propaganda.' 'We will not let her go back to Russia': Anton Geraschenko, an aide to Ukraine's Interior Minister, said Miss Duritskaya would not return to Moscow over the probe into the death of the Vladimir Putin foe . Honoured: People  applaud as workers carry the coffin of Kremlin critic Boris Nemtsov during a ceremony at the Sakharov centre in Moscow, where his body was laid in state after he was shot dead on Friday . Mr Nemtsov, a father of four, first gained an international profile after being spotted by former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher as a future leader of Russia. He was Russia's deputy prime minister from 1997 to 1998 during Boris Yeltsin's presidency, but found himself on the fringes of the country's politics after a tanking economy forced Yeltsin's resignation. The politician founded a number of opposition movements after leaving the Russian parliament in 2003 and he had served as the co-chair of the opposition Republican Party of Russia - People's Freedom Party since 2012. It has been reported that Nemtsov angered Putin's government two years ago when he charged that billions of dollars had been stolen from funds designated for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, his hometown. In January 2011, he was sentenced to 15 days in jail after being arrested at a New Year's Eve protest rally for 'disobedience towards police'. Murder: Flowers lie at the scene of Mr Nemtsov's murder, while police divers search the Moskva River for the gun that was used to gun him down. He was a key figure in Russia's liberal, pro-West opposition . Pro-West in his ideology, Mr Nemtsov had told U.S. diplomats he wanted to take Russia on a pro-EU, pro-Nato course, including eventual membership of both organisations, according to a diplomatic cable released by Wikileaks. 'The key, Nemtsov argued, was to present this strategy as the only viable choice for Russia,' wrote a U.S. embassy attaché in the note dated February 2006. But, the diplomat continued, 'Nemtsov also realizes that his association with the Yeltsin era will probably limit support for any initiative with his name on it, and he is counting on the next generation of politicians to carry the liberal banner.' Putin has claimed Mr Nemtsov's murder - yards from the Kremlin - was a 'provocation'.", "answer": ["Anna Duritskaya, 23, told police she had received anonymous threats .\nShe was with Boris Nemtsov, 55, when he was gunned down in Moscow .\nNow back in Ukraine, she had complained she was being held in Russia .\nNemtsov family reveals they have had no contact from murder detectives ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "(CNN)Ferguson City Manager John Shaw resigned Tuesday in the wake of a scathing Justice Department report. The report blames Ferguson, Missouri, police and courts for abusive behavior that disproportionately targets African-American residents. \"Over the last several months I have done everything in my power to work with countless groups to bring about positive change and strengthen our community,\" Shaw wrote in his resignation letter. He continued: \"During this time I have also worked closely with the Department of Justice to identify opportunities to improve, and then moved quickly to implement its recommendations for change. \"And while I certainly respect the work that the DOJ recently performed in their investigation and report on the City of Ferguson, I must state clearly that my office has never instructed the police department to target African Americans, nor falsify charges to administer fines, nor heap abuses on the backs of the poor. Any inferences of that kind from the report are simply false.\" Shaw's resignation was announced the same day the City Council voted 7-0 on a mutual separation agreement with Shaw. Residents elect City Council members, who in turn appoint the city manager. The city manager directs and supervises all city departments, including the Police Department. Along with other officials, Shaw was heavily criticized by the Justice Department report, which found that authorities in Ferguson frequently saw residents as \"sources of revenue.\" In fact, the city enjoyed so much success in issuing tickets and fines that Ferguson, population 21,000, was ranked in the top eight of the 80 municipal courts in St. Louis County by having more than $1 million in revenue in 2010, the report said. In one March 2012 email, the captain of the patrol division reported to Shaw that court collections the previous month reached $235,000 -- the first month collections exceeded $200,000. The city manager reported the email to the City Council, congratulating police and court staff on their \"great work,\" the report said. When Ferguson court revenues exceeded $2 million for the whole of 2012, the city manager responded to the police chief in an internal email: \"Awesome! Thanks!\" according to the federal report. The DOJ's probe came after public outcry over the death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown, who was shot by Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson in August. Wilson, who was not indicted on any charges, has resigned from the police department. But when Ferguson resident Sue Schmidt defended Wilson at Tuesday's City Council meeting, she heard vocal objections from those in the crowd. \"I'd like to say a lot of people in this room owe Darren Wilson an apology,\" Schmidt said, prompting laughter by some in the audience. \"The same justice report that you're basing all your opinions on cleared him 100%.\" CNN's Jennifer Feldman, Holly Yan, Sarah Aarthun and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.", "answer": ["John Shaw: \"My office has never instructed the police department to target African Americans\"\nA Department of Justice report blames Ferguson police and courts for abusive behavior .\nFerguson resident: Many people owe former Officer Darren Wilson an apology ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "Veteran BBC DJ Paul Gambaccini has accused the police of launching a 'witch hunt' against innocent celebrities to cover up their failures over Jimmy Savile. The 65-year-old said he had suffered 'a year from hell' as officers tried to drum up their case against him after he was arrested in 2013. He was finally told he would not face any sexual assault charges in October. Mr Gambaccini also claimed he had been 'left out to dry' on bail for months longer than necessary because the police did not want people to see a former Radio 1 DJ cleared before their case against his former colleague Dave Lee Travis had concluded. Scroll down for video . The 65-year-old veteran DJ Paul Gambaccini said he had suffered 'a year from hell' by officers trying to drum up their case against him after he was arrested in 2013 . Mr Gambaccini told the Home Affairs Select Committee the police had launched a 'witch hunt' to protect their reputation . Travis was convicted of molesting a 22-year-old researcher in September, just weeks before the case against Mr Gambaccini was dropped. Mr Gambaccini blamed his arrest on the 'moral panic' sparked by the revelations over Savile which exposed the police's own failures to stop the prolific paedophile. 'I faced the full weight of the state with unlimited financial resources for 12 months for no reason - it was a completely fictitious case,' he told the Home Affairs Select Committee. He said: 'Someone whose identity we do not know, who I call the Wizard of Oz, the person sitting behind the curtain, pulling the levers, setting off smoke and light shows, decided \"I've got a great idea, let's have a witch-hunt, let's divert the attention of the public from the police who knew about but failed to stop Jimmy Savile in his lifetime and shine that spotlight instead on his contemporaries and we'll get perverts from show business in the 1970s and 1980s''.' The furious BBC DJ added: 'When you open a website and a phone line - as the police did - for the dedicated purpose of accusing celebrities, then you are going to get some people who are responding to the offer of money and attention.' He told MPs there was no excuse for his treatment and urged them to overhaul the law to protect innocent victims from spending months on bail. 'It's obvious they wanted to keep me in the frame, because my name got out to the press '[but] there is no possible excuse for leaving someone out to dry.' He added: 'You don't need a witch hunt to enforce the law.' He also accused the Crown Prosecution Service of carefully timing the extensions of his bail to coincide with big sex abuse cases, such as the Rolf Harris trial, in order to avoid public scrutiny over their flimsy case against him. Mr Gambaccini blamed his arrest on the 'moral panic' sparked by the revelations over Jimmy Savile which exposed the police's failure to tackle abuse over decades . Mr Gambaccini told MPs he was 'left out to dry' until the end of the case against Dave Lee Travis. He also said he was re-bailed to coincide with the case against Rolf Harris (right) While Mr Gambaccini was making the accusation it emerged Harris had been stripped of his CBE, awarded to him by the Queen . The 84-year-old Australian was awarded the CBE in 2006 for his services to entertainment but it has now been retracted following his sentencing to six years in prison after being found guilty of sexually assaulting girls as young as seven-years-old. Mr Gambaccini said he had lost faith in the British justice system and revealed he had lost £200,000 in wages and legal fees after his arrest. The US-born DJ was re-bailed several times during his ordeal – and only found out about one after it had been reported to the BBC and ITV. Mr Gambaccini accused the CPS of having 'sat on the case' for eight months and said he 'enthusiastically' supports 28-day bail limit. He said the only reason for delay is to 'get someone else to accuse you'. Mr Gambaccini had his bail extended  when publicist Max Clifford was sentenced for indecent assaults . He told the committee that during that time, his bail was extended on seven occasions with only 'vague' explanations from police, but he gradually realised that the dates often coincided with important developments in the Yewtree investigation. Bail was extended on May 2, when publicist Max Clifford was sentenced for historic indecent assaults, on June 30, hours after the conviction of Rolf Harris and on September 12, when former Stoke Mandeville doctor Michael Salmon appeared in court charged with rape, he said. 'You know what they say. Twice is a coincidence, three times is a trend,' said Mr Gambaccini. 'It was kind of interesting when I was rebailed the same day Max Clifford was sentenced. It was kind of infuriating when I was rebailed the same day Rolf Harris was convicted. But then when I was rebailed again when Michael Salmon was charged, I thought 'OK, what they are doing here is trying to bury the news of my being rebailed forever, because if anybody wanted to write an article about Yewtree on those days, it wouldn't be about me, it would be about the other suspects'.' When his bail was extended to September 15, he suspected a link to the trial of Dave Lee Travis, which was due to end on that date. 'I thought, 'This is the most obvious thing in the world. They are sitting on me until they are finished with Travis, because they don't want the Travis jury to know that a former Radio 1 DJ can be innocent'. 'I do believe - though I don't have any evidence for this - that they were just sitting on me until Travis was finished,' he said. The veteran disc jockey told MPs that no one was above the law, but said celebrities were more vulnerable to false allegations because more people know them. He added: 'This person went after me because I was the famous person in his neighbourhood.' After dropping their case against him, the CPS revealed that the allegations against him involved two underage boys who were around 14 and 15. Other celebrities including comedians Jim Davidson and Jimmy Tarbuck have had their names dragged through the mud after Yewtree investigated them over decades-old allegations. Paul Gambaccini accused the police for launching a 'witch hunt' against innocent celebrities . Dubbed the Professor of Pop for his encyclopedic knowledge of music, Paul Gambaccini had been a BBC radio DJ for 16 years when he was arrested last year. The 65-year-old, who is openly gay, was born in New York. He gained citizenship to the UK in 2005 despite starting with with the Corporation in 1973 as a reporter on John Steel's Radio 1 show, Rockspeak. He read politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford University as well as studying at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. Despite his success, Mr Gambaccini said he was victim to homophobic treatment within the BBC where his personnel file was reportedly marked with a Christmas tree as he was 'camp as Christmas'. He entered into a civil partnership with model Christopher Sherwood in 2012. Following an ITV documentary in 2012 which exposed the depraved paedophilia of Jimmy Savile, Gambaccini publicly condemned the Jim'll Fix It star, describing him as 'an enigma'. 'He was not all good, he was not all bad, he was an enigma.,' he said on Daybreak. 'You just didn't mess with Jim. 'He was the governor, because after all he had been the first great club DJ, he had been the originator of Top Of The Pops and you just let him have his turf. 'And none of us were interested in going there. 'At social occasions we would all be together, but Jim would not be. He had his own life,' he said on live television. He added he had been waiting for 30 years for the public to be made aware Savile's abuse. 'I've been waiting for this to come out for 30 years, but then he did raise millions for charity. 'This comes out when he's dead because he had an imperial personality in showbiz, and I'm not talking about personal life.' 'Once he was phoned and he said, 'Well, you could run that story, but if you do there goes the funds that come in to Stoke Mandeville Hospital. 'Do you want to be responsible for the drying up of the charity donations?' And they backed down.'", "answer": ["Veteran DJ  said he had suffered 'a year from hell' after arrest in 2013 .\n65-year-old was told he would not face any sex assault charges in October .\nMr Gambaccini told MPs he was 'left out to dry' by the police for months .\nBlamed his arrest on 'moral panic' sparked by the revelations over Savile ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "Vincent Kompany was benched by Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini for Wednesday night's visit of Leicester City. The captain was one of five changes from the side that lost 2-1 at Liverpool on Sunday. Kompany, 28, has been criticised for a series of high-profile errors. Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany (right) was dropped to the bench for the visit of Leicester . Kompany has come in for criticism this season following a number of high-profile errors for the champions . He gave away a penalty against Arsenal, could have done better with both of Barcelona's goals in a 2-1 Champions League defeat and was dispossessed by Philippe Coutinho in the build up to Jordan Henderson's strike for Liverpool at Anfield. A poll in the local newspaper, the Manchester Evening News, saw fans vote to drop Kompany from the squad. Pellegrini has backed the Belgian, who he described as 'a great player', but rested him for the clash with Nigel Pearson's bottom-of-the-table visitors. Midfield pair Samir Nasri and Fernandinho dropped out of the squad altogether while Pablo Zabaleta and Edin Dzeko were alongside Kompany on the bench. Wilfried Bony, a £28m signing from Swansea City, made his full debut alongside Sergio Aguero while Martin Demichelis partnered Eliaquim Mangala at the heart of defence in place of Kompany.

{"question": "(CNN)An Iraqi man watching his first snowfall in his new American hometown was shot and killed by an unknown assailant, according to Dallas police. Authorities have stepped up patrols in the neighborhood where Ahmed Al-Jumaili lived -- and died -- in their effort to find out who killed the 36-year-old early Thursday, as he and his brother stood in the parking lot of his apartment complex watching the snow. Al-Jumaili's wife was with them taking photos. Dallas police spokesman Jeff Cotner said Al-Jumaili, who recently immigrated to the U.S., had never seen snow and \"just like all of us, a pretty snowfall brings the child out in us.\" There is \"extreme heartache ... and no shortage of sadness for this beautiful young man who had just come to this country 20 days ago,\" said Alia Salem, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in the Dallas and Fort Worth area. CAIR became involved in the case immediately after the shooting, according to Salem, because of \"a heightened sense of awareness with regard to hate crimes against Muslims.\" Salem said the Muslim community wanted to know whether the shooting death was random or whether  Al-Jumaili was targeted. Police say they have no indication so far that it was a hate crime. When shooting broke out, Al-Jumaili cried \"I'm hit!\" according to Cotner, basing that on statements from witnesses and the victim's relatives. He ran to his apartment nearby and died a few hours later. Police did not say where Al-Jumaili was struck or how many times he was shot. Some residents reported seeing two to four men enter the apartment complex on foot through a vehicle gate before the shooting, according to Cotner. He said there was no interaction between the men and Al-Jumaili and his family. In black-and-white soundless surveillance video, one person who appears to be carrying a rifle is seen running just ahead of a second person, Dallas police Officer Monica Cordova said. The second person is shown walking at a slower pace, holding what appears to be a handgun in his right hand. Approximately 13 seconds later, another person comes into view and passes by the camera, followed by a fourth individual who is walking, she said. From the vantage point of the camera, it is difficult to make out any of the features of the suspects or even the gender, although police have said they are looking for four black males. Witnesses say multiple shots were fired from what is believed to be a rifle. Cotner said police are conducting tests to find out whether more than one rifle was used in the shooting, but he said he could not reveal the make or model of the weapon. Cotner said Friday that other than that, police have little to go on. \"We can't solve this crime alone,\" he said. Authorities are appealing to the public to contact them with any information that might help the investigation. North Texas Crime Stoppers is offering a $5,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest and an indictment, police said. Salem is encouraging anyone with information about the shooting to share it. She said there are online campaigns underway to help raise funds for the family's expenses, as well as an effort to raise additional funds to contribute to the reward.

{"question": "'Monster': Convicted child killer Osvaldo Rivera, 34, Osvaldo Rivera, 34, has pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a 2-year-old boy . A southern New Jersey man who is in prison for killing a 6-year-old boy has admitted sexually assaulting a 2-year-old in a separate case. Osvaldo Rivera, 34, pleaded guilty to sexual assault Monday. Under terms of the plea deal, Rivera faces 15 years in prison to be served concurrently with the 110-year sentence he is already facing after a jury found him guilty of the murder of 6-year-old Dominick Andujar and the sexual assault of that boy's 12-year-old sister, Amber in September 2012. The sexual assault of the younger child, a 2-year-old boy, was the month before that. The Camden County Prosecutor's Office said DNA evidence submitted to a state database helped link Rivera to the crime. Rivera is scheduled to be sentenced in the toddler assault case April 17. 'Rivera had to be held accountable for the crime he committed against this toddler, regardless of having been previously sentenced to life in prison in another case,' Assistant Prosecutor Christine Shah told Philadelphia Inquirer. In July 2014, a Camden jury found Osvaldo Rivera guilty of the murder of Dominick Andujar, as well as charges of attempted murder, aggravated sexual assault, burglary and weapons violations.

At around midnight on September 2, 2012, Rivera broke into the Andujar family's home in Camden and attacked then 12-year-old Amber Andujar as she slept on the couch. Amber began to scream, which awoke 6-year-old Dominick - and he rushed to his sister's aid. The small boy fought with the attacker and managed to free his sister in the process. Amber, who was bleeding after being slashed in the throat by Rivera, ran to a neighbor's home to call for help. By the time police arrived on the scene, the brave 6-year-old boy was dead after having his throat slashed.

Rivera fled the house after killing Dominick, and Amber was later seen running through the neighborhood, screaming for help while bleeding profusely from the throat. Emergency responders said the cuts were so deep they could see Amber's vocal cords. She later helped officers locate her rapist by telling them he was known by the nickname ’Popeye’ and lived in a Camden apartment. Police tracked him down to an apartment in the city and found him hiding between an upturned mattress and the wall. According to investigators, during his questioning Rivera had revealed that he had smoked 'wet,' a combination of marijuana and PCP, prior to the killing. During Rivera's sentencing last December, a defiant Amber Andujar declared: 'Today I stand here as a survivor.

{"question": "Even the world-renowned composer himself might have struggled to orchestrate better than Arsenal's 'Little Mozart' on his day. Rosicky earned that nickname during his five years with Borussia Dortmund, yet it was in Germany where he was labelled 'wasted talent' and Arsenal gladly signed the maestro in May 2006. 'When he is fit...' seem to be the same, old four words that crop up when Rosicky becomes the topic of discussion yet, even at the age of 34, he still knows how to make Arsenal tick. Tomas Rosicky earned the nickname 'Little Mozart' in Germany and he continues to make Arsenal tick at 34 . Olivier Giroud celebrates with Rosicky during their Premier League win against Queens Park Rangers . Rosicky has found minutes hard to come by at Arsenal previously but injuries can prove problematic . Pulling on the yellow of Dortmund from 2001, the all-round midfielder's potential was recognised. Remember Nike's Scorpion advert in 2002? Francesco Totti, Thierry Henry, Patrick Vieira, Paul Scholes, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos, Luis Figo and Ronaldinho, among others, playing in a 'secret tournament' hosted by Eric Cantona. Then, among the world's finest footballers, was a 20-something Rosicky. More than a decade on he is in his mid-thirties, and getting better with age. Take the former Sparta Prague youth's cameo against Everton on March 1, for example. There was a moment when Rosicky chased the ball from Phil Jagielka, to Ross Barkley, to Steven Naismith, then back to Barkley, and won the tackle. It merited a standing ovation, before he settled the bag of nerves the Emirates Stadium had become with an 89th-minute goal to make it 2-0. 'This geezer's unreal, how is he 34? Still producing moments of class like that, he's a brilliant player,' one supporter said in his analysis on ArsenalFanTV afterwards. Rosicky scores against Everton previously as he came on as a substitute with just eight minutes remaining . Rosicky shoots to make it 2-0 to Arsenal against Everton on March 1 and settle their nerves . Rosicky should start against Manchester United but is not guaranteed to do so under Wenger . Rosicky mocked up as his nickname 'Little Mozart' 87 - vs QPR (March 4) 8 - vs Everton (March 1) 9 - vs Monaco (February 25) 14 - vs Crystal Palace (February 21) 18 - vs Middlesbrough (February 15) That's exactly how it comes – in 'moments'. The Czech Republic captain doesn't devastate week in, week out yet he is guaranteed to put in a shift. The mentality to pass sideways is lost on Rosicky, who prefers to move the ball quickly and forward, showing as much energy and pace as those with years on him in the Premier League. Yet Rosicky – a one-two kind of player, who bleeds the Arsenal way – has averaged just 19 games per Barclays Premier League season under Wenger in his nine years in north London. The injury-prone playmaker has been unlucky, rupturing his knee tendon in 2008 before requiring surgery on an Achilles tendon in 2012. It cost him more than two years, and a niggle has always seemed to be round the corner since. Minutes have been hard to come by. Eighteen against Middlesbrough in the FA Cup, 14 against Crystal Palace in the Premier League, and just nine in the 3-1 defeat by Monaco in the Champions League at the Emirates. His eight minutes against Everton led to a rare start against Queens Park Rangers, and Wenger should persist with the playmaker. There is no doubt the Arsenal manager likes the man due a testimonial next year if he signs a contract extension. 'If you love football, you love Rosicky,' purred Wenger after their 3-2 win against Brighton & Hove Albion in the FA Cup fourth round. Rosicky treated that match as an exhibition. His assist for Mesut Ozil's first half goal was ridiculous enough before a no-look pass led to a one-two that allowed Rosicky to score a volley in the second. You may remember it better for Phil Neville declaring he would 'two-foot him' if he tried that in his neck of the woods, but most saw it as sheer class from a thinker that views football akin to chess. Rosicky makes a no-look pass against Brighton which pundit Phil Neville found disrespectful . The Czech midfielder used the same move a number of times during Arsenal's 3-2 defeat of Brighton . During interviews Rosicky can look uneasy, like a teenager making a television debut, not a player just one cap short of a century for Czech Republic. Modesty, can be another way to put it. This week we heard Zlatan Ibrahimovic, 33, has years left. Can Rosicky keep being his tireless self? Well, a Jaguar Land Rover may be aged but, when it's only got so many miles on the clock, it runs as good as any. Rosicky has been seen to by mechanics on the treatment table far more than he deserves but, with him now fit, Wenger should start the 34-year-old against Manchester United on Monday, then watch him go.", "answer": ["Tomas Rosicky's career has been hampered by injury at times .\nRosicky earned the nickname 'Little Mozart' at Borussia Dortmund .\nThe 34-year-old averages just 19 games per season under Arsene Wenger .\nRosicky starred in Nike's Scorpion advert in 2002 with others such as Francesco Totti, Thierry Henry, Luis Figo, Ronaldinho and Ronaldo ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "Roy Hodgson is confident in Harry Kane's ability to shine for England, it is just a case of whether there is space for him in the upcoming squad. This has been quite the season for the 21-year-old, whose 24 goals in all competitions is far and away the best tally from any English striker this term. That form has impressed Three Lions boss Hodgson, who has strongly hinted recently that Kane will earn a first senior call-up in two weeks' time. England manager Roy Hodgson is open to the possibility of calling up Tottenham striker Harry Kane . The Spurs front man has is a regular in the England Under 21 set up and has been in great form for his club . Kane was far from his best in the Capital One Cup final but Hodgson said he thinks the striker is 'ready' It is not just the Spurs man vying for a striking berth, though, with a number of other in-form, uncapped players hoping to be involved against Lithuania and Italy. Saido Berahino, Danny Ings and Charlie Austin have all impressed for their clubs this season - but it is Kane who is the main talking point. 'He's in my thoughts of course, he deserves to be,' Hodgson said, speaking at the London Football Awards, which raises funds for national charity, Willow. 'He's scoring goals for one of our top teams in the Premier League but I know him anyway, he's done a lot of good work for the Under-21s. Burnley striker Danny Ings (right) is among the names for a call up to the Three Lions first team . QPR's Charlie Austin (left) and West Brom's Saido Berahino (right) have both been in fine scoring form . 'What pleases me most is young players are getting their chance to play. In the past 19, 20, 21-year-olds would be loaned out or would have to sit back and wait for their chance. Now more and more of them are taking the chance when they get it. 'I'm delighted for him and we'll see when I select my squad at the end of month if he's in it.' Asked whether Kane was ready to make the step up to the senior side, Hodgson said: 'He's ready. If he wasn't ready he wouldn't be playing for Tottenham and scoring lots of goals. 'The question you ask is has the player got the quality and talent we're looking for and is there a space for him? 'If he comes in then someone's going to drop out and most forwards we've got have done quite well in the autumn. 'But I can't include everyone unfortunately. It's not always a question of are they good enough, it's a question of is there space at this time.' However Kane is the one gaining all the attention having scored 24 goals in all competitions this season . Wayne Rooney, Daniel Sturridge and Danny Welbeck look set to be involved in the squad, while Rickie Lambert and Jermain Defoe are other experienced forward options when the national team reconvene after a four-month break. 'I am looking forward to it, we all are,' Hodgson said. 'Certainly I and my coaching staff are. I hope the players are looking forward to it, too. 'It will be nice to see them again. We did plan a little meeting in January but we found another way of staying in touch with them. 'It will be nice to see them physically again and I hope to see them in as good a shape as I thought they were last autumn.'

{"question": "The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall chat happily as they give the corgis a bath while the Queen looks cheerful as she enjoys breakfast in bed. But while these might look like unusually candid snaps of the Royal Family, in reality, they are a clever spoof created by artist Alison Jackson. Inspired by next week's Mothering Sunday, Jackson has tried to imagine how you might treat your mother when she happens to be the Queen. Giving the corgis a bath: Charles and Camilla give the Queen's corgis a bath in a lurid pink bathroom . And according to Jackson, that means hosing down the corgis and carefully giving boiled eggs a regal makeover, complete with bearskin and crown covers. The next photo shows Charles and Camilla, who, as a mother herself will be expecting some treats of her own next Sunday, bathing the corgis in a vivid pink bathroom before drying them off with a patriotic Union Flag towel. Amusingly, the royal couple are seen following the bath up with a blow dry, with Camilla grimacing as Prince Charles accidentally blows hot air in her face. Next comes the big reveal, with the Queen looking thrilled as she is presented with her breakfast tray, a card that reads 'Keep calm and reign on' and three pots of the Body Shop's Vitamin E moisture cream. Anyone for a blowdry? Charles' poor aim leaves Camilla needing to close her eyes . A card fit for a Queen: Prince Charles is seen filling in a card that bears the slogan: 'Keep calm and reign on' Decoration: Charles is also seen giving a trio of boiled eggs a regal makeover, complete with a crown . Finally, Her Majesty is seen sharing her toast soldiers and eggs with her freshly washed - and now very happy - corgis. Jackson is no stranger to reinventing the Royal Family, having previously worked on 'photos' of all the senior royals, including the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. Others to feature in her work include Pippa Middleton, who was the subject of her Christmas pastiche, which depicted Miss Middleton desperately attempting to wrap up a corgi for the Queen. More risqué depictions of the Royal Family include a photo of the Duchess of Cornwall on the treadmill clutching a gin and tonic and another of Camilla, this time smoking a cigarette. Doing the wrapping: A suited Charles and a dressing gowned Camilla wrap up their gifts for the Queen . Breakfast in bed: The Queen, clad in a fetching green nightie, looks delighted as she is given her breakfast . Some for you too: The freshly washed corgis are then shown getting to share Her Majesty's meal .

That's about all police in Glades County, Florida, had to work with early Monday, hours after a van with 18 people inside ran a stop sign, crossed a four-lane highway and plunged into a shallow water-filled ditch. Eight people died. Ten others, including a 4-year-old child, were injured, according to police. Investigators don't know why it happened,  Florida Highway Patrol spokesman Lt. Greg Bueno told CNN affiliate WPBF. The driver died, and police haven't been able to interview passengers yet. \"Our hearts go out to the families of the victims,\" Bueno said. \"It breaks your heart to see something like this happen.\" Some relatives of the crash victims, all of whom were from the Independent Haitian Assembly of God in Fort Pierce, gathered at the rural intersection Monday morning. Others went to the church. \"We've lost a lot of family members, church family,\" Phillipe Dorce, who said he lost his father, told WPBF. \"All we can do is pray (to) God to help us out. Pray for us. It's very sad for us.\" Linda Dolce told the news site TCPalm.com that her grandmother died in the crash. She'd arrived from Haiti six years ago. \"She loved singing and helping people,\" TCPalm.com quoted her as saying. \"She was exciting; she was the best lady to us.\" Laura Lochard told the site that her uncle died in the crash, leaving behind four children, the youngest of which is 16, whom he brought to the United States from Haiti. He was like a father to her, too, she said. \"It's never easy to lose a person, but I have to be strong,\" she told the site. \"I'll never forget his smile.\" A pastor at the church, Sereste Doresma told CNN that parishioners had attended a revival in Fort Myers and had left Sunday afternoon. \"This is a very difficult day for us today,\" he said. The van apparently was traveling east on State Road 78 when it ran a stop sign at U.S. Highway 27 early Monday, authorities said. It then crossed all four lanes of U.S. 27 and stopped in a ditch that was partially filled with water. No one saw the accident on the rural stretch of roadway that's frequented mostly by commercial traffic, Bueno said. One of the passengers flagged down a passing vehicle, whose driver called police, the trooper said. Police had to remove the seats of the van to remove passengers, Bueno said. Among other things, investigators are looking into the capacity of the van. It appeared to be rated for 16 passengers, Bueno said. Of the passengers, all were adults except for the 4-year-old, who was in stable condition at a  hospital, Bueno said. Two of the adult passengers were in critical condition, he said.

{"question": "One in five gay teenagers in schools across Britain are being subjected to bullying by teachers or other adults, new research has shown. Another third of gay male pupils said they left school without being taught anything about HIV or safe sex, despite a spike in infections nationwide. A survey by the National Aids Trust (NAT), which quizzed more than 1,000 gay or bisexual men aged 14 to 19, also found that more than half had experienced some form of discrimination. More than half of gay teenagers said they had been bullied at school. While 99 per cent said they had been targeted by a classmate, 39 per cent said their tormentor was a teacher or adult (file image) Of those 99 per cent said they had been targeted by another pupil, while 75 per cent said they received online abuse, reports The Independent. However, another 39 per cent said the bullying had been at the hands of a teacher or another adult at their school. Deborah Gold, the chief executive of NAT, said: 'It's an incredibly high number. 'The idea that teachers or other adults at school are sometimes responsible for bullying and discrimination is utterly unacceptable.' The survey also showed a worrying lack of education among young men about the spread of HIV and safe sex, despite them being in the most at-risk group in the UK. Two thirds of those surveyed said they had not been given information about testing for the killer virus, while a third were given no information about the spread of HIV. Another three quarters were also unaware of the drug PEP, which can help prevent infection if it is given to a patient within three days of them being exposed to HIV. A third of teenage boys said they had been given no information on HIV or safe sex, while two thirds said they didn't know how to test for it, despite being in the most at-risk group (pictured, the HIV virus) Three quarters of pupils also said they had been given no information on same sex relationships during sex educations lessons. Ms Gold added: 'The number of young men who have sex with men who are contracting HIV is increasing. I think there's an absolute link between the lack of this education at a time when people need it and the consequences of that.' While education on HIV is required as part of the science curriculum, it is only recommended as part of social and health education classes, with campaigners calling its application 'patchy'. The most recent figures from Public Health England show that HIV infection rates among men who have sex with men are at an all-time high, and are continuing to rise. In 2012 there were 3,250 new diagnoses of HIV among this group, pushing the total to more than 40,000, of which around 7,300 were unaware they had the virus.", "answer": ["Survey found more than half of gay teens bullied for sexuality at school .\n99 per cent abused by classmate, but 39 per cent targeted by an adult .\nA third also left school with no education on HIV or having safe sex ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "Real Madrid are hoping that a win against Levante on Sunday night will help them make peace with their fans, who have turned on the team after a recent poor run of form. Carlo Ancelotti's men have come under fierce criticism after squandering their lead at the top of La Liga, with Marca's front page on Sunday referring to the situation as a 'pressure cooker'. Levante are the visitors to the Bernabeu, in what AS have described as a 'trial run' for next week's El Clasico. The match at the Nou Camp on March 22 will go a long way to deciding this season's La Liga champions, and Ancelotti will be desperate to reclaim Madrid's spot at the top of the table. The front page of Marca leads with the headline, 'Pressure Cooker' ahead of Real Madrid's game on Sunday . Madrid face Levante at the Bernabeu on Sunday night, while Barcelona beat Eibar 2-0 on Saturday . There will be changes in the starting line-up for the Levante clash, the Spanish papers claim, with Keylor Navas expected to get the nod ahead of Iker Casillas. The Spanish veteran made a number of high-profile mistakes against Schalke in the Champions League last week. Sergio Ramos and Luka Modric are also expected to start, in order to get themselves ready for El Clasico. Marca carry a quote from Madrid boss Ancelotti, who has stated that his team are 'hurt, but won't let our heads drop'. Barcelona continued their good form on Saturday, comfortably beating Eibar 2-0. The win means that they have extended their lead at the top to four points - and it is up to Madrid to close the gap with victory on Sunday.

Messi has taken his tally to 32 league goals for the season, overtaking rival Cristiano Ronaldo in the process. In Italy, much of the focus is on Juventus ahead of their Champions League clash with Borussia Dortmund. Massimiliano Allegri's side beat Palermo 1-0 to 'send a message to Borussia', who they beat 2-1 in the first leg of their Champions League last 16 game a fortnight ago.

{"question": "Not many people were more excited for the first day of spring - weather in sync or not - than Jillian Tenen. The 29-year-old events planner moved to Boston from Florida two years ago and doesn't have any family in town. When the first of many record-breaking snowfalls dumped down on the city in January, Tenen was sick with the flu, and didn't dig out her 2007 Honda Civic. Only the snow didn't stop, and the street plows only pushed more mounds in and around where her car was parked in Bay Village. By the time Tenen got her shovel out, it was all-but too late. 'I'm 5' 2,' and it was all ice, an iceberg on top of my car,' Tenen told The Boston Globe. 'I couldn't reach it. I couldn't lift it. And even if I could, there was nowhere to put it. I just didn't know what to do.' After a few laughs, quite a lot of tears, and at lease one breakdown, Tenen realized she had no choice but to abandon her car until winter passed. It's under the iceberg: Jillian Tenen was sick with the flu during the first big snow of winter in Boston in winter, and after failing to dig out her car, it ended up under this mountain of snow on Isabella Street in the Bay Village neighborhood . There it is: Recently, some of the 'iceberg' began to clear and the car - or at least its shape - became a little more clear . Not again: But with this winter being Boston's snowiest ever, the heavens kept opening and the car kept getting buried . Bleak: Jillian Tenen's car is seen parked on Isabella Street in Boston on February 23, 2015. Winter 2015 yielded the largest record snowfall in the city of Boston's history . Clearing up: Jillian Tenen's car went through weeks of storms and melting snow, staying frozen in place at the same on-street parking spot . Almost there: By last week - March 12 - and after two months almost, the Honda Civic was almost ready to escape its cave . Finally!: On March 16, Jillian Tenen's was finally back on the road, seven weeks after it was first snowed in . Yay! All-smiles, Jillian Tenen finally got behind the wheel of her car on March 18, and was shocked that it started right away . But after seven weeks, and a heap of chipping, the car has finally freed from its icy cave. Sadly not much could be done about the damage. The windscreen buckled under the weight of the snow and is all smashed up. There were also deep dents in the roof. But, surprisingly, the car started on the first go after it had thawed. Tenen said her insurance company will now assess the damage. While she hopes that future winters won't be so severe, and will plow her car diligently from now on, she learnt a valuable lesson. 'If I had to do it again, I would definitely do one thing differently,' she told The Globe. 'I would not park on the corner.' Although the storm didn't cripple Boston as previous storms have, it still created a nuisance for snow-weary residents .

And each one had a little  'rider', a cuddly toy dressed a jockey's uniform, holding on to the sheep's reins . The couple were flanked by Conde Nast president Nicholas Coleridge and Conservative MP Nicholas Soames, who looked equally amused by the fluffy runners.

{"question": "It rather summed up a week when he made headlines for all the wrong reasons that Rory McIlroy should find the water twice on the 18th hole at the WGC-Cadillac Championship at Doral on Sunday. On American television over the weekend it was impossible to escape footage of him tossing his three iron into the water on Friday. Before the start of play, Donald Trump, preposterous owner of this overrated venue, had presented McIlroy with the said club, after it was retrieved by a scuba diver. How typical of Trump that he plans to have the club mounted in the hotel, thereby glorifying an action that would have every regular golfer drummed out of their club if they tried it. Rory McIlroy hits a shot from the ninth fairway during the final roudn att the WGC-Cadillac Championship . McIlroy's round was shaping up nicely before his unfortunate finish on the 18th hole . The World No 1 tries to play his way out of trouble during a disappointing final round at Doral . McIlroy himself is keen to put the incident behind him and did his best with a round that was shaping up nicely until an unfortunate finish. He stood on the 18th tee tied for sixth but put his drive into the water on this brutal hole and then, after adding a penalty shot, his third shot as well. At least he didn’t lose his sense of humour. He feigned to throw another club in the drink, but this time held on to it. Through the back of the green in five, McIlroy was facing a difficult chip down the slope and staring down the barrel of an ugly triple or worse. Typical Rory. He chipped it in to the end the tournament with a more characteristic demonstration of his usual swagger. The resultant double bogey meant he signed for a 71. He still finished in the top 10, though. All those missed putts, shots and water adventures therefore, and still only a handful of players beat him. Among the leaders, it was hard not to feel sorry for American JB Holmes. He began with a five-stroke lead but got his choke in early. Bubba Watson plays a shot out of a bunker on the 11th hole at Trump National Doral Blue Monster Course . There was a seven-shot swing in the first seven holes between him and Bubba Watson, leaving the Masters champion with a two-shot advantage. Watson, however, then dropped a couple of shots himself. With eight holes to play there was a three-way tie for the lead involving these two and fellow big hitter Dustin Johnson. One of the best rounds came from England’s Danny Willett, who shot 68. The 27-year-old, early leader of the Race to Dubai, is getting more comfortable at this rarefied level, and this was a fine confidence boost ahead of his first appearance at The Masters next month. The resultant top-15 finish boosted his world ranking and, as a member of the top 50, assured him of a first appearance in a regular PGA Tour event at the Arnold Palmer Invitational in 10 days. He will also play the Houston Open before Augusta. Dustin Johnson winds up a shot on the 10th hole during a strong final round for the American . ‘I’m obviously very pleased,’ he said. ‘It’s a tough course and the set-up is very difficult so to finish on level par for the week, I’d have bitten your hand off if you’d offered me that on Thursday. When you’re playing with the top 50 you know they’re not going to give you anything, but I’m feeling more comfortable all the time.’ How far can he go? One area of concern remains a chronic back injury that has caused him to withdraw from plenty of tournaments over the years and one this year already. ‘I’m taking painkillers and managing it,’ he said. ‘I’m going to stay over here through the Masters because flying back and forth is no good for it. There’s no point worrying about it, I’ve just got to get on with it.’ He is doing that all right.", "answer": ["Rory McIlroy found the water twice on the 18th hole at the WGC-Cadillac Championship at Doral .\nThe resultant double bogey meant he signed for a 71 .\nJB Holmes began brightly with a five-stroke lead but faded away .\nOne of the best rounds came from England’s Danny Willett, who shot 68 ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "It's a milestone age that many women face with trepidation. However, approaching 50 doesn't appear to be phasing Elizabeth Hurley. Estee Lauder has renewed her contract for the 21st year in a row, she has a lead role in the new (and unapologetically daft) US series The Royals and her swimwear line is selling well in Saks Fifth Avenue and Harrods. It's now nearly 21 years since the British actress, model and businesswoman  was catapulted into the spotlight at the Four Weddings and a Funeral Premiere. Scroll down for video . Looking regal at nearly 50: Elizabeth Hurley, pictured above promoting new US television series The Royals, puts her enduring beauty down to covering herself in moisturiser from a young age . Show-stopper: The Versace dress worn by Elizabeth at the premiere for Four Weddings and a Funeral put her on the front page of every newspaper. She calls the dress 'a landmark dress in fashion history' Just being on Hugh Grant's arm would have garnered headlines enough but famously pouring herself into that revealing black Versace dress saw her steal the entire show, even if she was thereafter constantly referred to as 'Hugh Grant's girlfriend'. Elizabeth tells the Times that the moment was actually less about her and all about the dress: 'It was such a landmark dress in fashion history. Like nothing to do with me. It was the dress.' The black, strappy ensemble, seemingly held together with large gold safety pins, kickstarted her previously quiet career which, two decades on, has seen her try her hand at everything from acting and modelling to owning her own organic food company and designing her own swimwear. Her looks have very much remained flawless despite the ageing process. Still pin thin, there's barely a wrinkle on her, something which she puts down to nothing more than a lifetime of lathering on moisturiser - with at least SPF30 if she's in the sun - and a great diet. If plenty of older female stars have spoken out about ageism against women recently, any obvious discrimination seems to have passed Elizabeth by. She says there are 'a lot of girls who are doing advertising campaigns who are my age or more. It's a very nice time as far as that's concerned.' 'Quite sexy': Elizabeth's new show The Royals sees her play Queen Helena, based on an 'obviously fictitious' royal family living in modern-day London. Joan Collins plays her mother and was handpicked by Elizabeth . Flawless skin (...and plenty of diamonds): The star (pictured left in a recent selfie) says she hasn't experienced ageism in Hollywood and has had her 21-year contract with Estee Lauder renewed . It's hard to believe but exercise has hardly featured 'for years' thanks to a gruelling work regime that means she doesn't find it easy to make time for working out. Her current schedule, she says, sees her picked up at dawn and not home until 8:30pm in the evening. New show The Royals, described as 'obviously fictitious' sees Elizabeth playing the character of Queen Helena reigning over modern-day England, with Joan Collins, who was handpicked by her, playing her mother. She says of the show: 'It's fun, it's a drama - it's not a comedy but it's lighthearted. It's quite sexy.' She admits that her 12-year-old son Damian, born in 2002 to entrepreneur Steve Bing, was privy to some of the racier scenes, having spent part of his school holidays on the set. Father and son: Liz fell pregnant in 2001 by business magnate Steve Bing. Although Mr Bing denied that Damian, now 12, (right) was his child, a DNA test proved otherwise . Taking a sabbatical from relationships: After plenty of romances including a marriage to Arun Nayar, an engagement to Shane Warne and a short friendship with financier David Yarrow, Elizabeth is enjoying a break . Still the one? They've been apart longer than they were together but the lives of Elizabeth and Hugh are still very much entwined with both being godparent to the other one's child. Hugh is pictured above with Elizabeth's son Damian at a fundraising event in 2013 . After a string of high-profile relationships, Elizabeth seems to be settling for the single life as she approaches her fifties. Speaking on The Jonathan Ross show, she said: 'I am single. On sabbatical. I'm busy at the moment, family, work, I'm working more now than I ever have been, no time for love.' Her life is, she readily admits, still entwined with former beau Hugh Grant's. Although the couple have now been apart for longer than they were together, there seems to be few signs of the friendship fading. The actor is godfather to her son Damian, born in 2002 to entrepreneur Steve Bing and she has returned the favour, being godmother to one of Hugh's daughters, Tabitha. She told Jonathan Ross: 'We're best friends. He lives next door to me and he's godfather to my son and I'm godmother to one of his children. 'We've been apart for longer than we were together. We were together for 13 years and then we've been best friends for 15.' When pushed by the television presenter on a possible romantic reunion, she dismissed the idea, saying: 'I don't think that's going to happen...but he's the best friend that anyone could have.' After a brief dalliance with Steve Bing which resulted in a DNA test to prove his paternity of Damian, she married Indian textile heir Arun Nayar in 2007 after a five-year relationship, with a ceremony in the UK and a lavish six-day ceremony in Jodhpur, India. A new episode in the life of Elizabeth: The star has been promoting new E! show The Royals . When the relationship crumbled five years ago, a series of headline-grabbing romances followed including an engagement to Australian cricketer Shane Warne. Her most recent paramour was said to be hedge-fund financier and wildlife photographer Steve Yarrow. It seems, with son Damian, a small herd of pets to nurture including five dogs, chickens, alpacas and piglets, that she already has more than enough affection in her life. 'I am much more country girl than town girl. When I had my son, it got quite difficult in London to get any privacy and so I bought a farm in the country, in Gloucestershire and lived out there for a while and did full-time farming.' The actress has a rather clever way too of filtering out calls to her office too. She's known by close family not as 'Liz' or 'Elizabeth' but an undisclosed moniker. 'No-one calls me Liz or Elizabeth. If someone rings the office and says anything about 'Liz', we know they've never met me.'", "answer": ["The British actress and businesswoman will turn 50 in June .\nPuts her enduring beauty down to a lifetime of lathering herself with moisturiser... but admits to doing very little exercise .\nHas a new role as Queen Helena in US series The Royals .\nFormer flame Hugh Grant is 'her best friend' and 'lives next door'\nThe animal-lover has five dogs, chickens, piglets and alpacas ."], "label": "SUM"}

Three months later, his family said he died of a heart attack in Venezuela, his body cremated there instead of returned home. He was arrested this weekend on fraud charges in North Carolina . Jose Lantigua, 62, and his 57-year-old wife, Daphne Simpson, have been jailed on seven Florida insurance fraud charges each after he was arrested by federal agents on Saturday in North Carolina . FBI agents execute a search warrant at the Sapphire, North Carolina, home of Jose Lantigua on Monday. Lantigua, a Jacksonville businessman reported dead two years ago in Venezuela, was arrested in North Carolina on Saturday on alleged fraud charges after his life insurance companies filed a lawsuit alleging he was alive and they shouldn't be making payments . He replaced the bookkeeper he'd used for years with a relative. He built a panic room with steel doors inside his North Carolina hideaway. And, prosecutors say, he and his wife began planning his fake death to scam almost $8 million from insurance companies. No matter how the criminal case turns out, his arrest gives a resolute end to a long-running court battle between Lantigua's family and insurance companies that refused to pay off on his life policies because, for many reasons proven right, they didn't think he was dead. 'I've never seen anything quite like (this case),' said Joe Licandro, a Jacksonville prosecutor working the case. 'There was always a suspicion, but they were able to evade authorities as long as he did, and she didn't have any missteps either - until recently.' Lantigua, who had emigrated to the U.S. as a youth, purchased Circle K Furniture in 2008 after claiming to have served more than 20 years as a senior officer in the U.S. Army, where he claimed to have earned the Silver Star, the nation's third-highest military honor for bravery. Jose Antigua with his heavily-pregnant daughter Christina on New Year's Eve 2013 before he allegedly faked his own death. Friends had left messages of condolence to her following her father's reported passing in 2013 . Months after her father's alleged passing, Christina Lantigua posted this picture of them together and friends posted their condolences below. Neither the businessman's daughter or son, Joseph, have been charged with a crime . The Army has not responded to requests for confirmation. He also graduated from Florida International University in 1989 with a degree in computer science, the school said, and claimed degrees in management, mathematics and physics and aerospace engineering from Pepperdine University, Northwestern University and the University of Florida, respectively. UF said he attended the school but did not earn a degree and Northwestern had no record of him. Pepperdine did not immediately respond to a request for confirmation. By the time Lantigua bought Circle K Furniture, it had grown from a few items sold from the corner of an old feed store to two large Jacksonville showrooms offering everything from contemporary to country-style pieces made from logs. Problems surfaced in 2012, when Lantigua told friends and colleagues he'd fallen ill and needed to go to Venezuela to get an experimental treatment not available in the United States. Simpson stood by his side with an expression of worry, people who know the couple said. Records showed they sold their Jacksonville-area condo for $600,000. About this time, Circle K was also developing financial problems. No one suspected anything suspicious at first, said Kathleen Leis, who was Circle K's bookkeeper. But as the company's debt grew into hundreds of thousands of dollars, she said Lantigua kept buying furniture for his family with company funds. Still, she trusted the man, whose kindness she said she leaned on previously when she had problems. Then Lantigua replaced her as bookkeeper with his sister-in-law. 'I wasn't given a reason except I was needed more on the floor and his sister-in-law couldn't sell furniture,' she said. Before long, Lantigua headed to Venezuela to deal with his alleged illness. Lantigua ran the once successful Circle K furniture company (pictured) but the business began to slide into debt in 2010 . Lantigua, 62, and his 57-year-old wife, Daphne Simpson, are jailed on seven Florida insurance fraud charges each after he was arrested by federal agents on Saturday in North Carolina . It was there, in April 2013, that his family said he died of a heart attack, his body cremated there instead of returned home. Circle K's stores closed a month later and the company soon filed for bankruptcy. Lantigua's family began filing life insurance claims for the nearly $8 million in policies he'd obtained. At his June 2013 memorial service at High Point Community Church in suburban Jacksonville, Lantigua's daughter, Christina, sang 'Amazing Grace' and the pastor read words of hope as his widow looked on. Meanwhile, American General Life Companies had suspicions about the $2 million claim Lantigua's son, Joseph, had filed, particularly the Venezuelan death and cremation certificates accompanying it. First, the physician who signed Lantigua's death certificate never received or examined the body. The investigators also said there had been no autopsy. Finally, the crematorium that had supposedly been used was 250 miles from where Lantigua supposedly died. Investigators found that suspicious. 'The insured's body was purportedly not prepared in any way prior to the cremation and likely would have rapidly decomposed during the lengthy travel in high temperatures,' American General said in court documents. The crematorium representative who signed the certificate was paid to generate false documents, the company said. Last November, American General denied the claim and lawsuits were filed. Joseph Lantigua has not responded to several phone messages  seeking comment. No contact information for Christina Lantigua could be found. Neither has been charged with a crime. American General's findings piqued the interest of local and federal prosecutors, who opened an investigation that included surveillance. At the time of his supposed death, Lantigua and his wife had been building a home at the top of a steep, narrow road on Hogback Mountain in North Carolina, a remote vacation destination near Asheville. 'It's possible that he's been hiding out there these past couple of years,' said Licandro, the Jacksonville prosecutor. Residents of the nearby village of Sapphire said the area is perfect for hiding out: only a couple hundred people live there and they keep to themselves. But Lantigua apparently thought trouble was coming. He built a bunker in his basement complete with 20-inch thick steel doors, said a contractor who worked on the house. 'It made me wonder why would you need a panic (room) here? There's not that many people around here you got to worry about,' said Forrest Boutte, 28. Boutte said Lantigua was a nice, straightforward man. On Saturday, U.S. State Department security agents arrested Lantigua near the Hogback Mountain home. The passport he had used to get back into the U.S. had proved his downfall. The man whose name Lantigua was trying to steal was black — the photo Lantigua submitted showed he is white. The Social Security number he used was from a woman born in 1917. Suspicious, State Department agents used facial recognition software to discover his true identity. Finding him wasn't hard — while the other information on his passport application was allegedly forged, he listed his supposed widow as his emergency contact and gave the correct North Carolina address. For those who knew him, the news that he was still alive was startling. 'I'm just shocked. He didn't seem that type at all. He seemed to me an upstanding, Christian family man. He was nice to everybody and wanted help people,' Leis said. It was there, in April 2013, that his family said he died of a heart attack, his body cremated there instead of returned home (pictured) At the time of his supposed death, Lantigua and his wife had been building a home at the top of a steep, narrow road on Hogback Mountain in North Carolina, a remote vacation destination near Asheville .", "answer": ["Jose Lantigua, 62, and wife, Daphne Simpson, 57, jailed on insurance fraud charges after he was arrested by FBI on Saturday in North Carolina .\nIn April 2013, his family said he died of a heart attack in Venezuela and his body cremated there instead of returned home .\nThe passport Lantigua used was his downfall - the man whose name Lantigua was trying to steal was black .\nThe Social Security number he used was from a woman born in 1917 ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "The bereaved parents of a Minnesota teen with a severe dairy allergy who died from eating pancakes are suing the small town diner where he was served them. Cindy Johnson, mother of 16-year-old Scott Johnson, says she asked staff at the Minnesota Nice Cafe in Bemidji if their gluten-free pancakes were also dairy-free during a rare dining-out last June for the teen, who'd suffered from the deadly allergy since birth. Johnson was assured the pancakes were safe and watched as her son ate two of them, reads the complaint. Three days later, Scott would be dead. Assured they were okay: The bereaved parents of a teen with a severe dairy allergy who died last year after eating dairy-laced pancakes are suing the diner that served them to him . Severely allergic: 16-year-old Scott Johnson of Bemidji had been to the hospital due to dairy exposure before. His family had learned to be very careful about what and where he ate . 'He had just finished and he said ''we have to go now,\"' Cindy Johnson recalled of the moments after Scott, her second of four children, ingested the fatal breakfast. Scott had suffered allergic reactions before, even from the slightest exposure to dairy. Previous trips to the emergency room had taught his family to be extremely cautious. 'If it wasn’t right, we didn’t eat until his was right,' Scott's father Steve Johnson told WCCO. However, the Johnsons say they were assured by staff at Minnesota Nice that everything would be fine. And it just so happened that Scott had forgotten to bring along his life-saving EpiPen and nebulizer that June day. Cindy rushed her son home. But when they got there, the epinephrine and nebulizer failed to calm Scott's short-circuiting immune system. 'I was eighteen miles off the highway when I got the call,' said Steve Johnson, who was two hours away on a construction job when he learned his son was in dire straits. 'Hardest thing for me was I didn’t even get to talk to him.' Special breakfast: The family didn't normally go out to eat, but Scott's sisters wanted to treat him and their mother one morning last June . Communication failure? According to the complaint, the Minnesota Nice Cafe staff assured Cindy that her son's pancakes contained no dairy. Cindy also maintains she told them the grill would have to be cleaned before Scott's pancakes were cooked on it . Doctors told the Johnsons the dairy exposure had led to anaphylaxis so severe that Scott's heart had stopped. Three days after the family breakfast, Scott died. Now the grieving mother and father are facing massive medical bills and want the Minnesota Nice Diner to take responsibility. 'Just one mistake can take someone’s life,' Cindy Johnson said. The Minnesota Nice Cafe owners are not commenting publicly on the pending case. As the case moves forward, a benefit has been organized for July at which a raffle and auction will be held to benefit the Johnsons financially. Friends of the family have also set up a GoFundMe page, where donations can be made to help the family offset the cost of medical bills. Tragic: Scott had forgotten his lifesaving EpiPen and nebulizer that day in June when his immune system went haywire at the Minnesota Nice Cafe . Cindy rushed her son home, but when they arrived his EpiPen and nebulizer didn't seem to work .

{"question": "Rhiannon Blair was left in tears after her classmates poured lighter fuel over her precious notes and set them ablaze - destroying years of hard work in a few seconds of mindless vandalism . This is the shocking moment a gang of bullies set fire to a schoolgirl's GCSE coursework - before sending her a video of the cruel prank. Rhiannon Blair was left in tears after her classmates poured lighter fuel over her precious notes and set them ablaze - destroying years of hard work. The 15-year-old had not realised the work was missing until she was sent the video by her tormentors - who were suspended for just three days after the act of mindless vandalism. The footage shows the teenage bullies laughing and joking as they poured lighter fluid over the pile of papers on a picnic bench and set it alight. One boy even attempted to fan the flames by spraying it with a deodorant can while another threw in a lighter which eventually caused the notes to explode. A pupil then climbed onto the bench to trample over the cindered books. Police yesterday were investigating after the footage was posted online, but confirmed there had been no arrests so far. Rhiannon said she has been the victim of a campaign of bullying at Easthampstead Park Community School in Bracknell, Berkshire, since last September and suffered from anxiety and depression as a result. She now fears the stunt may put her entry to college in jeopardy. She said: 'I was shocked and disgusted when I was sent the video by one of the pupils involved. None of them seems to be sorry for what they have done or show any regret. I am just very upset and tearful that all my hard work has gone to waste. 'I have always wanted to work with children and it is what I had set my heart on doing for the rest of my life. I am not even sure if I can get a place on my course at the college anymore. I can't understand why anyone would do this.' The  teenager, who dreams of a career as a nursery nurse, was just two weeks away from submitting the coursework when the bullies destroyed her work. One of the bullies shouts 'put a lighter on it' as another prepares to set fire to Rhiannon's coursework . Two boys reel away as the flaming pile of notes explodes thanks to a lighter that had been thrown on them . Her mother, Debbie Groom, said: 'I am so angry. These pupils have ruined my daughter's life. I would be mortified if that was my child carrying out that sort of behaviour. 'This incident is going to scar Rhiannon for life. She has been very stressed and upset but the reaction to the video being posted online has been amazing - it just shows that people do not like bullies.' Another pupil, 15-year-old Kayleigh Holloway from Hanworth, also had her child development coursework destroyed in the pile. Her uncle Neil Holloway said: 'I am disgusted by what has happened. I don't think the three days suspension given to the children involved was not enough punishment. 'They have all probably seen it as a nice holiday. Even though the school has said her grades won't be affected that is not the answer or what we want to hear. 'Kayleigh was very upset when she found out - she has got enough going on in her life without all of this.' Rihannon's mother Debbie Groom (pictured with Rhiannon's family, L-R:  aunt Anne Yates, mother Debbie Groom, Rhiannon Blair and her sister Katie Blair) said the incident had scarred her daughter for life . Headteacher Liz Cook said letters had been sent out to everybody involved in the incident and assured the victims that their grades would not be affected. She said: 'The school has investigated the incident at length and its origins were a falling out between girls, property was taken as a spiteful act designed to disrupt the victim's lesson the following day. 'On reflection students have realised this act was a huge error of judgement on their part and have been shocked that their act has attracted a social media storm. 'This has been a steep learning curve for them all. The victims of the theft are also being supported as we make every effort to make sure their hard work and studies are not compromised.

'That's the law': Appearing on Channel Nine's Today breakfast show on Thursday, model Jesinta Campbell was asked about her views on the imminent executions of Bali Nine ringleaders, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran . They were convicted for smuggling heroin into Indonesia from Australia in 2005. 'It's so sad. I mean, watching all the footage play out on the news... it breaks your heart because you can't help but feel for their families and they are two humans at the end of the day,' Jesinta said of the polarising situation. She did however stress that despite being strongly against the death penalty herself, the laws in Indonesia regarding drugs are widely known. 'But, like a lot of Australians believe, at the end of the day unfortunately, Indonesia has these rules and if you break them these are the consequences. 'It's so sad, I do not agree with the death penalty, but that's their law.' Sharing her thoughts: 'It's so sad.

Jesinta is a regular on Today, offering her intelligent opinions on everything from serious current affairs to light-hearted topics. The likely area on Death Island where Chan and Sukumaran will take their final breaths is called, Nirbaya. Found in the island's remote centre, Nirbaya was also the place where the Bali bombers, Amrozi, Ali Gufron and Imam Samudra were executed in 2008, six years after they carried out the nightclub bombings which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, 38 Indonesians and 27 Britons. On Wednesday, Black Sabbath rocker, Tony Iommi, wrote a letter to Indonesia's President, Joko Widodo to ask for clemency for the Australian pair.

'I appeal to you, as a forgiving man, to take note of their transformation,' Tony Iommi wrote in a letter to President Joko Widodo about the two Australian drug smugglers on death row. 'They are now reformed men who are making a positive difference to the lives of their fellow prisoners. 'For this reason, I would ask that you stop the execution of Andrew and Myuran. 'Please allow them to serve out life sentences where they contribute to the well-being of Indonesia and make good for the error of their previous ways.'

Ms Bishop told parliament on Wednesday that Indonesian authorities were preparing for the execution of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. 'On behalf of the parliament, I respectfully ask of the Indonesian president that he spare the lives of these two Australian citizens,' Ms Bishop said. She said she had spoken with the two families on Wednesday morning. 'As you can imagine they are devastated but they are just living day by day,' she said. A plea for clemency was rejected in January but since then the government has been seeking a permanent stay of execution. Ms Bishop said there were grounds for clemency and the government believed there were still legal avenues open to the pair. 'The grounds are that both men have shown immense remorse for their grave crimes and... have undergone an extraordinary rehabilitation'.

In the Senate, Attorney-General George Brandis said the government had made at least 22 representations to Indonesian officials since January in a bid to save the two men. That included letters and phone calls from Prime Minister Tony Abbott, Ms Bishop and the Australian Federal Police. ASIO chief Duncan Lewis and Attorney-General Department secretary Chris Moraitis had also been sent to Indonesia to plead for the pair. However the Indonesian ambassador has defended his government in a letter responding to a Senate attempt to save the Bali Nine duo. Nadjib Riphat Kesoema said the decision not to pardon the pair was very difficult for President Joko Widodo on both a personal and humanitarian level. However, the drug problem had 'blossomed into a national emergency' and required strong law enforcement. 'Most tragically, drugs and their traffickers and producers have denied too many people including children of their right to life,' he wrote. Mr Kesoema said both cases had been granted due process of law and all legal avenues had been pursued. He defended the court's decision to impose the death penalty and said separation of powers meant the government could not meddle in judicial processes. The upper house had argued the sentences should be commuted to a prison term due to the pair's genuine remorse and rehabilitation.

Britain's skies began to darken at around 8.24am this morning as the Moon started to move between us and the sun, with the eclipse peaking at around 9.30am across the country. Today's eclipse produced a 100-mile-wide 'totality' shadow path that crossed the North Atlantic, resulting in a partial eclipse across the northern hemisphere, including the whole of Europe, Greenland, Newfoundland, northern Africa and western Asia. Is that it? A less enamoured Maxima took off her glasses early and turned away . On tour: The Dutch royals are touring Hamburg today as part of a brief 48-hour tour of northern Germany .

{"question": "Robert Durst's lawyer has dismissed his clients apparent confession during the final seconds of HBO's The Jinx docudrama and said the unguarded comments could be interpreted in a 100 different ways. The six part series concluded last Sunday with the eccentric millionaire off camera talking to himself in a bathroom with his wireless microphone still live. 'There it is. You're caught. Killed them all. Of course,' Durst was heard to mumble to himself. Scroll down for video . HBO's six part docudrama concluded last Sunday with eccentric millionaire Durst off camera talking to himself in a bathroom with his wireless microphone still live . Durst was heard to mumble to himself 'killed them all, of course' in an unguarded moment off camera featured at the end of the final episode of HBO's The Jinx . Durst was arrested by police in New Orleans just hours before the show was broadcast and has since been charged with murder in the December 2000 shooting death of Susan Berman. There is speculation that Durst's explosive comments could be used against him in court, but attorney Dick DeGuerin said they prove nothing. 'There's one hundred ways of interpreting it ... one of 'em being very Shakespearean. The soliloquy,' he told 48 Hours. Famously used by Shakespeare in a number of his plays, a soliloquy is an act of speaking one's thoughts aloud when by oneself or regardless of any hearers. For instance Hamlet's 'To be or not to be' speech. 'If you are a student of Shakespeare, as I am, you'll understand that what I'm talking about,' said DeGuerin. He said he first heard Durst's recorded comments 'along with the rest of America' when it was broadcast last Sunday. Dick DeGuerin, the lead attorney on Durst's team, has compared his client's apparant confession to a Shakespearean soliloquy and claims that it could be interpreted in a hundred different ways . The lawyer also said that it is well know that Durst talks to himself and 'that's just one of his quirks.' 'There are people who feel like he got set up. ...My daughter's a journalist, and she was outraged at what Jarecki and his producers pulled.' DeGuerin also said he was 'astonished' that Durst was interviewed by Los Angeles prosecutors for three hours without his lawyer present after his arrest last Saturday. 'Bob is not sophisticated, he is intelligent, he's got Asperger's,' said DeGuerin explaining why his client hadn't simply refused to speak until he had his counsil present. DeGuerin filled court papers on Friday in which he claims Durst was illegally arrested on charges that he murdered a woman in California, as well as drug and weapons charges filed in New Orleans. In the papers filed at the State Criminal District Court in New Orleans, Gibbens and DeGuerin asked a magistrate judge to schedule a preliminary hearing so that they can prove that there is no probable cause to keep Durst jailed. They argue that he should be released. 'I think he's an easy target and everybody's piling on. ... They're gonna find nothing,' DeGuerin, the lead attorney on Durst's team, told KTRK-TV. DeGuerin also accused Andrew Jarecki, the director of The Jinx, right, of setting up Robert Durst . 'I think Louisiana and their elected officials want a piece of the publicity pie.' The judge agreed to schedule that hearing during another court appearance by Durst on Monday in New Orleans. The attorneys also asked the judge to order that evidence be preserved from the hotel where Durst was arrested. They are seeking any and all records related to Durst and Everett Ward, the pseudonym Durst used to check into the hotel. The documents blasted the arrest, which the attorneys say was orchestrated 'to coincide with the final episode of the HBO docudrama The Jinx. Durst, a member of a wealthy New York real estate family, was charged with murder in California for the December 2000 shooting death of Susan Berman. Durst's arrest came shortly before the HBO finale about his links to three killings — that of his first wife, who disappeared in New York in 1982; Berman, the daughter a mobster and a close friend who acted as his spokeswoman after his wife disappeared; and a 71-year-old neighbor in Texas whose dismembered body was found floating in Galveston Bay in 2001. Frail: Durst is on suicide watch at a Louisiana detention center. He is expected to appear in court on Monday . Durst has only ever been tried for the Texas killing, and he was acquitted of murder. Durst waived extradition in New Orleans but he is being held there on charges that he was a felon in possession of a gun and with illegally carrying a weapon with a controlled substance. Court documents say investigators found nearly $43,000 in cash, a gun and a rubber mask that could cover his head and neck in his hotel room when he was arrested. Authorities have also said marijuana was found in the room. However, Durst's attorneys say his previous convictions are not serious enough to merit the gun charge. He has been charged in Los Angeles with first-degree murder in the 2000 killing Susan Berman, the daughter of a mobster and a close friend who acted as his spokeswoman after his wife disappeared in New York in 1982. Durst, 71, who is estranged from a family that has a real estate empire worth an estimated $4 billion, has long denied killing Berman and Kathleen Durst, who was declared dead even though her body was never found. Investigators had reopened that case and planned to speak with Berman when she was shot once in the back of her head at her home near Beverly Hills. After the killing, Durst disguised himself as a mute woman and moved into a cheap Galveston, Texas, boarding house where he killed an elderly neighbor in 2001. He claimed self-defense and was acquitted of murder but was convicted of unlawfully disposing of the man's body, which was found chopped up and floating in Galveston Bay. While legal experts said Durst's remarks off-camera and to filmmakers during the production will most likely be admissible, prosecutors will have to decide if they outweigh the possibility that the defense would play other portions of interviews showing him denying any killing. 'I would see this moment of unguarded truth as worth a lot of those denials,' said George Fisher, a former prosecutor and professor at Stanford Law School. 'The flat out meaning of the statement is very clear on its face.' In the case of Blake, prosecutors sought to introduce a portion of a jailhouse interview of the actor discussing his family with Barbara Walters because it contradicted other evidence. The defense then successfully pushed to bring in the rest of the interview. 'It did a great deal both to humanize him and so he wasn't just seen as a celebrity,' said M. Gerald Schwartzbach, who won Blake's acquittal on a murder charge involving the killing of his wife. 'There was an image projected that a lot of people had about Robert as a difficult person. In this video, he came across as a very sympathetic person.' Prosecutors are not commenting on the Berman case while Durst is still held in Louisiana, where he also faces firearms charges.", "answer": ["Dick DeGuerin, the lead attorney on Durst's team, has dismissed his clients apparent confession during HBO's The Jinx docudrama .\nHe said Durst's 'killed them all' remark could be interpreted in a 100 different ways .\nEven compared his client's apparant confession to a Shakespearean soliloquy .\nDeGuerin also accused Andrew Jarecki, the director of The Jinx, of setting his client up ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "An epileptic hospital patient was forced to sleep on the floor for four weeks while he was waiting to have a scan on his brain. Michael Collins was kept in a receiving ward, normally for short stays of no more than two days, after being admitted to the Royal Infirmary in Glasgow. He hit his head during an epileptic seizure, making him prone to violent outbursts - so hospital staff removed his bed from the room and made him sleep on a mattress on the floor. It took three weeks before Mr Collins, 54, was given a chair, and though he has now moved to another hospital he is still waiting for an MRI scan six weeks after the accident. Hospital: Michael Collins had to spend four weeks in a room without a bed while waiting for a scan . Relatives of the former roofer, from Glasgow, are desperate to find out what is wrong with him, but until he has the scan - which will take around 45 minutes - they are still in the dark. His partner Suzanne Brown, 50, said: 'We took him to A&E at the Royal and he was kept in overnight. 'He had another fit the next morning so they kept him in for another few days. But a couple of days later he walked out of the hospital at 3.30am. 'He threw all his medication away and walked out dressed only in his slippers, pyjamas and housecoat. 'Clearly, mentally he was not right. Before he banged his head he was fine. He had no mental health issues whatsoever.' Precaution: Mr Collins had to sleep on a mattress on the floor after he behaved violently . Waiting: He did not even get a chair in the room for his first three weeks in hospital . Ms Brown initially took Mr Collins to the GP after he hit his head, and was then referred to A&E. 'We waited seven hours in casualty,' she said. 'Then he was put in a receiving ward. You are supposed to be there for a maximum of two days. 'He was supposed to be going to the Southern to get an MRI scan and a lumbar puncture but they cancelled his appointments three times. 'They're sedating him because of his outburst in the waiting room but he's not that kind of man. It's terrible to see him like this. 'I know there is something wrong with his brain. If they would just give him the scan we could find out what is the matter with him. 'I thought they would at least have given him a bed with cot sides so he couldn't get out or do himself an injury. A&E: Mr Collins spent four weeks at the Glasgow Royal Infirmary, pictured, before moving to another hospital . 'When he went in at first he was quite violent, throwing things about, so they took everything out of his room. 'He keeps going back to when he was a boy and still thinks his mum and dad are alive.' Ms Brown praised the way doctors and nurses looked after Mr Collins before he was moved to the Southern General Hospital, but criticised the NHS for failing to treat him promptly. A spokesman for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said: 'The patient presented with extremely challenging behaviour and for his own protection and personal safety had to be nursed with only a mattress in his room. 'We accept there were delays in transferring him to the Southern General. We also accept a delay in providing the appropriate tests which need to be undertaken with specialist clinical input.

A crowd of 93,013 witnessed Australia claim their fifth world title as a match that promised so much ended up being incredibly one-sided. New Zealand were always looking for a miracle after being bowled out for a below-par 183 in 45 overs, despite 83 from Grant Elliott – as Mitchell Starc bowled Brendon McCullum for a duck in the first over.

Australia's players sprint on to the field after beating rivals New Zealand by seven wickets at Melbourne Cricket Ground . Australia captain Michael Clarke (right) shakes hands with Brendon McCullum after being dismissed for 74 . New Zealand's players look dejected after their disappointing innings cost them the chance of glory in Melbourne . In response, Clarke and Steve Smith shared a 112-run third-wicket partnership as Australia cruised to victory in 34 overs. McCullum called right at the toss and on a sun-bathed Melbourne Cricket Ground the New Zealand captain understandably chose to bat. So often the 33-year-old’s own innings sets the tempo of the Black Caps innings and on Sunday it was no different. Having come out swinging and twice been beaten, McCullum was bowled for a duck by a full, in-swinging Starc delivery that cannoned into off-stump. It sent the MCG crowd into a fit of delirium as a wicket fell in the first over in a World Cup final for the first time ever. Aggressive starts to matches with the bat has seen New Zealand boast an average run-rate of 7.70 in first 10 overs of their innings during this tournament but Australia’s early stranglehold on their opposition saw them make just 31 for one. Clarke’s inspired bowling change provided the next breakthrough as the impressive Glenn Maxwell bowled Martin Guptill (15) with just his second ball. And six balls later New Zealand were reduced to 39 for three as Kane Williamson departed for 12 having attempted to block the explosive Johnson but only succeeded in sending the ball straight back to the bowler. It was the perfect start for Australia and Clarke remained on the attack with two new New Zealand batsman at the crease. But Ross Taylor and semi-final hero Elliott steadied the ship and slowly began to rebuild, with the latter top-edging Starc for a 72-meter six into the leg side. The pair shared a 111-run fourth-wicket partnership and looked to have brought New Zealand back into the match only for the batting powerplay to spark a dramatic collapse. James Faulkner, who is quickly becoming one of the best powerplay and death bowlers, was brought back into the attack and immediately had Taylor caught behind for 40. The 24-year-old Tasmanian deceived the batsman with a slower ball and Brad Haddin took an exceptional low catch, diving to his right, with the ball dying on him. Two balls later the heavy-hitting Corey Anderson was sent back to the pavilion having failed to score as he was beaten for pace as the ball came back off his pads and shattered the stumps. A double-wicket maiden in a World Cup is impressive, a double-wicket maiden in a powerplay to induce a collapse is sensational and looked to be the potential match-winning moment. Five out quickly became six as wicketkeeper Luke Ronchi’s time at the crease lasted just six minutes as he edged Starc to Michael Clarke at first slip for a four-ball duck – the first two overs of the powerplay accounting for three wickets and just a single run. Meanwhile, Elliott – fresh from his semi-final match-winning unbeaten 84 - continued to time the ball sweetly as all those around him played as if they had never picked up a bat before.

Australia's Steve Smith attempts an acrobatic catch after a shot from New Zealand's Grant Elliott . And, whereas Clarke’s one-day international swansong was going to plan Daniel Vettori could only muster nine before a full in-swinging yorker from Johnson hit the 36-year-old’s pad and rattled onto the stumps. New Zealand were crumbling and Elliott having effortlessly moved to 83 became Faulkner’s third victim of the afternoon as he mistimed his shot and an outside edge was gleefully taken by Haddin. When needed most, the Black Caps tail failed to wag and the final wicket run-out perfectly summed up both side’s days up to that point. Boult defended a short Johnson ball to Maxwell at short leg and in a single move the allrounder picked up the ball and hit the non-striker’s stumps. Tim Southee’s bat stuck in the ground and he was run-out, as New Zealand stumbled to 183 all out. It was telling that Australia leaked just 12 fours and three sixes against such a fierce and deep batting line-up and added further proof of their remarkable day in the field. Early wickets were going to be vital if New Zealand were going to make their first World Cup final they have featured in competitive and their best bowler, Boult, delivered.

Both Australia and New Zealand stand for the national anthems at a packed Melbourne Cricket Ground on Sunday . Aaron Finch attempting to push a fuller ball off his legs only succeeded in hitting the ball into his pads, up into the air and into the waiting Boult’s hands. The Kiwi fans, silent for large parts of the first innings, were now making themselves heard but David Warner soon quieted them once again. Warner found the boundary seven times in his 45 off 46-balls before Matt Henry claimed his first wicket of the World Cup having batsman caught at deep square leg, attempting to pull the ball. The loss of the second Australian wicket put McCullum back into an aggressive mindset and Clarke was welcomed to the field with seven catchers and only one man outside the 30-yard circle. But the right-handed batsman was equal to the task and having passed fifty he smacked Southee for four successive fours before chopping on a slower ball from Henry, having made 74 off 72-balls. And, Smith (56 not out) hit his fifth consecutive half-century as the MCG erupted in jubilation as the celebrations begun. It was a disappointing end for New Zealand who had been brilliant with the bat and ball and in the field throughout the World Cup.

Valentina grabbed attention after posting on YouTube a video that appeared to have been shot from a hospital bed. 'I urgently request to speak to the president because I'm tired of living with this illness,' said the teenager, whose older brother died at age 6 from the same disease. 'I want her approval so I can get a shot that will make me sleep forever.' Maureira, a 14-year girl who suffers cystic fibrosis and asked the Government for permission to die through a YouTube video, at the Clinic Hospital of Catholic University of Santiago de Chile . Cystic fibrosis damages multiple organs, especially the lungs, by causing recurrent infections that damage tissue. Valentina said she was frustrated by the lack of options and by how the disease had hurt her quality of life. On Thursday, presidential spokesman Alvaro Elizalde expressed sympathy for Valentina's plight, but stressed that Chilean law does not allow euthanasia. 'It's impossible not to be overcome by emotion with the girl's request; it's impossible to grant her wish,' Elizalde said. Chile's government on Thursday rejected a plea from 14-year-old Valentina Maureira (above) to be euthanized . In an interview with The Associated Press on Thursday, the girl's father, Fredy Maureira, said he supported his daughter's request, though he added that he 'cried through the night' after he first heard about her wish to die. 'This is so tough, but I have to respect her decision because she's the one who's suffering this illness,' Maureira said. Shortly after her video picked up attention online the Chile government rejected her plea. Presidential spokesman Alvaro Elizalde said Thursday that although 'it's impossible not to be overcome by emotion with the girl's request, it's impossible to grant her wish,' because it's not allowed under Chilean law. Elizalde said the health ministry was in contact with Maureira's family and was providing her psychological assistance as well as medical treatment. In a statement issued by the hospital, Castillo said she had been transferred out of the critical pediatric patient unit. 'Right now our therapeutic efforts are aimed at the recovery of her nutritional state and supporting her family,' he said. Scroll down for video . Maurerira suffers from cystic fibrosis, and watched her older brother die from the disease when he was just 6-years-old . Valentina's father said she will continue trying to meet with Bachelet, so the president, who is also a pediatrician, can 'listen to her life story.' 'This is so tough, but I have to respect her decision because she's the one who's suffering this illness,' said Fredy Maureira. 'I already lost a 6-year-old son because I didn't have enough money and organs. Now my daughter just wants to die in a dignified way,' he added. Maureira said that after he first heard his daughter's wish to die, he 'cried through the night.' The degenerative disease is affecting Valentina's liver, pancreas and lung, and she has said that she's frustrated by the lack of options and how much it has affected her quality of life. 'She's exhausted, we're all exhausted, but if she wants to keep fighting, I'll be by her side every second,' the father said.

{"question": "(CNN)Under harsh lights in a private, rented room in Berlin, women face each other in violent, sometimes bloody battles of brute strength. There are no official rules to this female fight club. The fighters are both beginners and professionals, anywhere from age 20 to 50, said photographer Katarzyna Mazur, who spent months documenting the club in 2013 and 2014. Led by founders nicknamed Anna Konda and Red Devil, a match might pit a bodybuilder against a martial arts master. They can wrestle, throw punches or \"cat fight.\" There's no judge, just someone who knows the parameters they've decided for the match. The small audience is mostly made up of men, but it's a place for women to shed the roles they play outside. \"When I saw this kind of fighting for the first time, I was quite shocked. I had never seen something like that before, and it was really interesting to experience all of this so close,\" said Mazur, who photographed the fight club as part of her work toward graduation from photography school. \"Inhibition and fear do not exist on the mat.\" At first, Mazur said, she shot the fight club in color, but the look of the blue mat and neon lights didn't satisfy her. She shifted to black-and-white images and reduced her point of view, getting as close as she could to the action. \"It was not easy to work like that, because the matches were going very quickly and were unpredictable,\" she said, although fighters were respectful and would stop if someone was seriously hurt. \"I had to be very careful not to get hit. Fortunately, there are chairs on the side, so I could jump on them if the female fighters suddenly rolled under my feet.\" For all the aggression built into fighting, Mazur said, the project required a lot of sensitivity. She had to work quickly, and she didn't always know her subjects well. The bouts, the motivations, the scene can all leave a lot of room for interpretation. Mazur said she had to examine her own limitations, questioning \"How far can I go? Do they trust me? Am I allowed to do that?\" Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. \"I enjoy exploring new worlds, especially a world which exists in a gray area,\" she said. She also had to remember that the fighters pushing and pummeling inside the club have lives outside, too -- they're mothers, partners, friends. Their actions on the mat might contradict how they live the rest of their lives. Even years later, the fight club is still running and is \"better than ever,\" Mazur said. \"Very often, I was very moved after seeing and editing the pictures, realizing what exactly happened there,\" Mazur said. \"It is important to always remember my role as a photographer and to always approach the subject with interest and (an open mind).\" Katarzyna Mazur is a Polish photographer based in Berlin.

{"question": "Carol Kirkwood, pictured at the Television and Radio Industries Club awards where she was crowned Best Weather Reporter for the seventh time, has been getting explicit pictures in the post . She has just been crowned Best Weather Reporter for the seventh time – so there is no doubt Carol Kirkwood is a hit with viewers. But the 52-year-old BBC Breakfast presenter has revealed some male fans are more than a little enthusiastic and send her explicit pictures in the post. ‘I do get letters from older men, fan mail,’ she said, gesturing to her nether regions. ‘It is terrible. I have had so many over the years. I am almost immune to it. You can tell by the hand writing. ‘I don’t have anyone who checks our mail as it all comes into the office. I don’t count them.’ Her smiley demeanour and shapely figure, which she often dresses in figure-hugging outfits, have attracted an army of admirers. On Tuesday she was given the Weather Reporter gong at the Television and Radio Industries Club (TRIC) Awards for the seventh time, beating off ITV rival Laura Tobin and the BBC’s Tomasz Schafernaker. Speaking at the awards ceremony, the presenter – who also does weather reports for The One Show – said she also receives sordid messages online. ‘You get a lot on social media. If they are on Twitter you block them,’ she said. She explained any explicit pictures sent to the office are quickly ‘binned’. The weather presenter is divorced from Jimmy Kirkwood, her husband of 25 years. But her new partner, whose identity is unknown, takes her legions of male admirers in his stride. She said: ‘My boyfriend is used to it. He just thinks it is funny. He does not take it seriously which is probably just as well.’ The broadcaster herself has taken a light-hearted approach to live TV slip-ups. Last year she battled on despite accidently ‘clicking her clicker’ twice, revealing scorching temperatures of 99 degrees in a place identified as ‘Town name’. Speaking about her live gaffes, Mrs Kirkwood explained: ‘We can’t see the weather map behind us. Sometimes the map and town doesn’t pop up behind me and that has happened numerous times. You just have to get on with it.’ The glamorous weather presenter said she receives fan mail from enthusiastic older men who would send the explicit pictures in the post . And is seems some viewers have very high expectations of her capabilities. ‘People do blame me for bad weather, definitely,’ she revealed. ‘And also people’s expectations are high. People wanted to see snow this year. Some parts saw snow but by no means everywhere.’ She believes women of her age have a lot to bring to the profession. ‘More and more we are seeing women my kind of age and possibly older coming through the ranks to present the weather. It is good as we offer a load of experience,’ she said.

She revealed: ‘Bill Turnbull has tried to do it but he is more like a ballerina. When you present the weather it is like tapping your head and rubbing your tummy at the same time. 'If you can do it whether you are a man or a woman, then you can do it. We have got brilliant weather men as much as we have weather women.

{"question": "A mother has revealed her horror after she discovered she married a paedophile. Mel Alford, of Exeter, Devon, said she only found out her husband Jonathan's past when he appeared in court to admit grooming an underage girl for sex. The 37-year-old, who has three children, first met the man she knows as JR, in April 2012 through Facebook as she was friends with his older brother. Mel Alford said she had no idea her husband Jonathan was a paedophile until he was in court . Ms Alford said she agreed to go on a date with him after he ‘kept sending nice messages’. She revealed: ‘We ended up getting engaged in August and brought the wedding forward to November that year when I found out my dad was dying from cancer. 'We were together most of the time and the start of our marriage was really good. He was great with my kids and treated me like a queen. 'I had no idea what he was really like until a social worker visited me and told me he was on bail for sleeping with an underage girl. 'That girl had come to my children's dad's house and told him and he contacted social services.' Ms Alford said that her husband denied it and pulled up what he told her was the girl's Facebook page which had a message to him saying 'sorry I lied’. Mel - pictured with Jonathan on their wedding day - said he treated her 'like a queen' She said: 'It turns out he had set up a fake account to send that message. 'Myself and the kids believed him so we just carried on. But he became so jealous after we got married and I could not answer the door in case it was a man and he would sleep outside in his car if we had a row. 'In September 2013 I kicked him out. But I didn't know the allegations were true until I saw he was in court.’ At Exeter Crown Court, Jonathan Alford admitted six counts of sexual activity with a child, seven of making or possessing indecent images of children, three of having extreme pornography and one of perverting the course of justice. Alford was also caught with child abuse and bestiality images on his computer and was jailed for seven years and three months in July last year. Ms Alford said she was totally unaware of his charges until he appeared in court and said struggled to believe that the man she loved and brought into her family was capable of such crimes. Jonathan Alford was jailed for more than seven years after he admitted admitted six counts of sexual activity with a child and other related offences . 'I went along to the court and shouted and screamed on every plea. I heard all about his sickening crimes,’ Ms Alford said. 'It was so disturbing I don't think it was really sinking in on the day. 'I walked into the middle of the court and called him a “dirty bastard”. He smiled at me and I just wanted to kill him. 'He had been brought into my family and been around my kids. I was sickened. Still all I know is what I heard in court that day. I still don't really know the full story. 'I never saw him again after that. I wanted to go to his sentencing hearing but because I had kicked off at the previous hearing the police wouldn't let me in. 'I have asked my kids if he ever tried it on with them and they have said no. But he should not have been allowed anywhere near me and my three children while he was on bail. 'There should have been checks done.' Ms Alford said she is now awaiting her final divorce papers to come through, and has set up an unofficial website to ‘name and shame’ offenders – which the police have told her to take down. She said: 'It has certainly made me a lot more cautious about people and I am passionate about what I am doing. 'I am proud to have met so many people and victims. I am not a counsellor but they tell me their story and I try and help them.’ She added: 'You have no idea who is a paedophile. I was married to one and did not know. 'I hear so many stories - many of them extremely heart-breaking. I just want people to be more aware of who they are dating and allowing to be around their children.’ She said: 'I carry a lot of guilt that I put my children in danger by having this man around them.

{"question": "(CNN)For those who hoped that the coming presidential election would usher in the dawn of a new, more inspiring politics, this past week has been deeply discouraging. In two key moments, leaders from both sides of the aisle have acted like the Bourbons of France, who famously remembered nothing and forgot nothing from battles of their past. The first and substantively more important moment was the sending of that letter by Republican senators to the Iranian regime. The second, and perhaps more important politically telling moment, was Hillary Clinton's handling of her emails. The two cases are oddly related. In both instances, the principals started with legitimate concerns but have wound up making things worse. In both cases, the principals have also created divisive issues that will deepen polarization through the campaign and probably into the next presidency. Both have diminished the chances for breaking out of today's ugly politics. Republicans in Congress have reason to press hard with their views as negotiations with Iran enter the home stretch. They, like many others -- including a sizable number of Democrats, the current Israeli government, and friendly Arab nations -- fear the Obama administration will cut a weak, leaky deal that will allow Iran to come perilously close to having nuclear weapons. Just as importantly, Republicans believe, with cause, that as he negotiates, President Barack Obama has tried to sideline Congress in general and them in particular. Who can blame them for arguing that if the President insists any agreement needs only executive approval -- not approval by Congress -- then the next chief executive should not be legally bound by its provisions? Their basic concerns were not unreasonable. Thus, if they had sent exactly the same letter to the President, they would have caused a stir but would have been seen as within the norms of politics and statecraft. Instead, they made the mistake -- a wicked one -- of sending it to the terrorist leaders of Iran, leaving a clear impression they were out to sabotage both the deal and the President. We have had renegade members of Congress try to interfere with presidential negotiations in the past -- remember Sen. Jesse Helms? -- but never 47 members of the United States Senate tossing a hand grenade into delicate, life-or-death negotiations conducted by seven major nations and led by the United States. Ayatollah Khamenei made clear this week that he may use the Republican letter as a pretext for rejecting any deal. Where do we go then? Will talks collapse? Will an Iranian rush toward the bomb set off a nuclear arms race, starting in Saudi Arabia, which is already taking preliminary steps? Will the United States then be compelled to use military force against Iran? Who knows for sure? What we do know is that Iran is now almost certain to become a central issue in the 2016 presidential campaign and that the Republican nominee will be under relentless pressure from the right to adopt a hard, unyielding line. One can just imagine a number of GOP candidates pledging that if elected, they will abolish Obamacare on Day 1 and an Iranian agreement on Day 2. This is hardly a way to restore steady, bipartisan foreign policies, as we so badly need. And why have Republicans forgotten so soon the damage done from voters thinking the last GOP president was too hard line and reckless? On the other side of the aisle, Hillary Clinton had absolutely legitimate concerns about the security of emails she might send as secretary of state. As one who spent a year and a half at the Clinton White House and State Department, I could see first hand how they -- more than any president since Nixon -- were hounded by enemies and reporters trying to ferret out secrets to cause trouble or win a prize. It is small wonder that both Clintons still have scar tissue. Hillary Clinton's mistakes did not start with creating an email protection system. No, they started when she and her team failed to coordinate up front with the State Department system and record all official exchanges within the government system on a prompt, air-tight basis. That did not break laws. But it did run afoul of government procedures and, when revealed, naturally gave rise to suspicions about what she might be hiding. In her press conference, she did accomplish her obvious mission: she began cutting legs off the story. In essence, she said one half of her emails (the official ones) are now safely with the State Department and, at her request, will gradually be made public. The other half (who knows what's in there?) have been deleted and she is keeping the server. In effect, she says, they are gone ... and gone forever, beyond Congressional subpoena, FOIA requests, and even hackers. What fresh revelations can the press now pursue? Not many. And how can Republicans browbeat her in hearings without looking like bullies? Hard to do. In short, the story may soon die. You just have to trust me, she says. Clever. But the very fact that instead of inviting a neutral, trusted party like Lee Hamilton to review all the emails, she chose to cut off the story by destroying the evidence comes with a price: she has freshly renewed public doubts whether she plays straight or by her own rules. Loyal Democrats will continue to invest their faith in her, but for many others, the controversy leaves a lingering sense of unease. And polarization deepens. She was always going to face a rough campaign, but now she will begin with clouds already gathering. More to the point, they will obscure her very real strengths as a leader. Around the world, many women look upon her with heartfelt admiration from her years of promoting their empowerment. And she has also has a strong case to make that she and her husband know something about job creation: 22.9 million were created in the eight Clinton years, more than in any other presidency since World War II (Reagan was second at 16.1 million; there have been some 6.4 million in the first six Obama years.). In short, she is worse off than she was before this controversy broke -- and so are American politics. Bill Clinton likes to say that politics is always about tomorrow -- and he is right. But candidates also need to remember and learn from yesterday. After this last week, they might start by reading a wonderful book by historian Barbara Tuchman published some 30 years ago: \"The March of Folly: From Troy to Vietnam.\" There she argues that leaders often start out trying to do the right thing but take a wrong path, stubbornly stick with it despite all evidence and eventually wreck. Tuchman calls their refusal to learn from experience \"wooden-headedness\".

{"question": "(CNN)A bill that would allow Utah to use firing squads to execute some death-row prisoners passed in the state Senate on Tuesday. The measure, which passed 18 to 10, will be sent to Gov. Gary Herbert, who has not said whether he will sign it into law or veto the bill. Herbert released a statement on the legislation, which would add death by firing squad as an option in a state that uses lethal injection. \"Our statute is clear that lethal injection is the method by which (an execution) will happen. We have no intent to change that,\" he said. The law would give the state the option to use a five-member squad in cases where the drugs necessary for lethal injection aren't available 30 days before the date set for the execution. \"Our state, as is the case with states around the country, is finding it increasingly difficult to obtain the substances required to perform a lethal injection. We are dedicated to pursuing all reasonable and legal options to obtain those substances to make sure that, when required, we are in a position to carry out this very serious sentence by lethal injection,\" the governor said. Eight people are on Utah's death row. Utah banned death by firing squad in 2004, though inmates who chose that option before the law changed still ended up being shot to death. The last execution by firing squad was in 2010, and it was also the most recent execution in Utah. A Utah firing squad also executed Gary Gilmore in 1977, the first death by capital punishment after the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty the prior year. In recent years, states have struggled to maintain a supply of lethal injection drugs as manufacturers either stopped producing the drugs or barred their use in executions. Texas nearly out of execution drug . The European manufacturers of pentobarbital, an anesthetic, explicitly banned U.S. prisons from using its drug in executions. Some states have sought out substitutes or gone with one drug instead of the traditional three-drug cocktail. In April, Oklahoma used midazolam as a substitute for pentobarbital as part of a three-drug cocktail in an execution that went awry. Clayton Lockett, a convicted rapist and murderer, writhed and convulsed after the drugs were administered. It took 43 minutes for him to die. Last week, Georgia postponed an execution because the drugs appeared \"cloudy.\"  The state also indefinitely postponed at least one other execution until it can analyze the cocktail it uses for the procedures, officials said.

Owner Kim Broughton (pictured) was left shell shocked after her prize Buff Orpington hen, which has now been re-named Ping Pong, laid the 'one-in-a-billion' perfectly spherical egg last month . The one-in-a-billion round egg (right) is pictured next to an ordinary slightly pointed egg (left) Ms Broughton, 44, said she thinks the winning bidder will probably preserve the unusual egg, rather than eat it. The perfectly spherical egg attracted 64 bids during the online auction. Ms Broughton said she had been tempted to cook and eat the egg before being told it was 'one-in-a-billion'. She said: 'I was literally about to crack it open to make a pancake when a mate saw the photo I put on Facebook and messaged me to say 'Don't do it!' 'Apparently somebody had sold one before for more than £90 so I thought \"Great if I can sell if for that\". 'When it was at £20 I thought 'Who'd pay that for an egg?' and then it went through the roof - it's unbelievable,' she told BBC Essex.

{"question": "(CNN)Iran's judicial system believes in the ancient concept of \"an eye for an eye\" -- literally. On Tuesday, a man convicted of blinding another man in an acid attack was himself forcibly blinded in one eye, according to Amnesty International and Tasnim News, a semi-official news website. The punishment is believed to be Iran's first case of Qasas, meaning retribution in kind, Tasnim News said. Amnesty International denounced the sentence. \"This punishment exposes the utter brutality of Iran's justice system and underlines the Iranian authorities' shocking disregard for basic humanity,\"  said Raha Bahreini, Amnesty International's Iran researcher. \"Meting out cruel and inhuman retribution punishments is not justice. Blinding, like stoning, amputation and flogging, is a form of corporal punishment prohibited by international law. Such punishments should not be carried out under any circumstances.\" The acid attacker had been hired by the victim's wife to throw acid in his face, Tasnim News said. Amnesty International said the attack occurred in 2009 in the city of Qom. The defendant was blinded in his left eye at Rajai Shahr Prison, but the blinding of his right eye was postponed, Amnesty International said. The man was ordered to pay \"blood money\" and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Amnesty International said punishment has been delayed for another Iranian man in a \"retribution in kind\" case. That man had been sentenced to be blinded and made deaf, Amnesty International said.

{"question": "Washington (CNN)The Justice Department is preparing to bring criminal corruption charges against Sen. Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, alleging he used his Senate office to push the business interests of a Democratic donor and friend in exchange for gifts. People briefed on the case say Attorney General Eric Holder has signed off on prosecutors' request to proceed with charges, CNN first reported. An announcement could come within weeks.  Prosecutors are under pressure in part because of the statute of limitation on some of the allegations. Menendez told reporters Friday night he has \"always conducted myself appropriately and in accordance with the law.\" He added: \"And I am not going anywhere.\" Menendez said that because of an ongoing investigation he couldn't answer questions at the news conference, held in Newark. The case could pose a high-profile test of the Justice Department's ability to prosecute sitting lawmakers, having already spawned a legal battle over whether key evidence the government has gathered is protected by the Constitution's Speech and Debate clause. The FBI and prosecutors from the Justice Department's public integrity section, have pursued a variety of allegations against Menendez, who has called the probe part of \"smear campaign\" against him. The government's case centers on Menendez's relationship with Salomon Melgen, a Florida ophthalmologist who the senator has called a friend and political supporter. Melgen and his family have been generous donors to the senator and various committees the senator is associated with. RELATED: FBI agents search office of Florida doctor known as Senator's donor . Investigators have focused in part on plane trips Menendez took in 2010 to the Dominican Republic as a guest of Melgen. In 2013, after word of the federal investigation became public, Menendez paid back  Melgen $58,000 for the 2010 plane trips calling his failure to properly disclose the flights an \"oversight.\" Menendez said he has been friends with Melgen for more than 20 years and the two families have spent holidays and other special occasions together. One of the highest ranking Hispanic members of Congress, Menendez is a former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He has become one of the Obama administration's most vocal Democratic opponents on two key foreign policy matters -- President Obama's decision to ease the trade embargo against Cuba and also his effort to engage direct negotiations with Iran over that country's nuclear program. Menendez advocated on Melgen's behalf with federal Medicare administrators who accused Melgen of overbilling the government's healthcare program, according to court documents and people briefed on the probe. Melgen was among the top recipients of Medicare reimbursements in recent years, during a time when he was also a major Democratic donor.  Melgen's attorneys have denied any wrongdoing. Prosecutors also are focusing on whether Menendez broke the law in advocating for Melgen's business interest in a Dominican Republic government contract for a port screening equipment. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency, at the time, considered donating port screening equipment to the Dominican Republic, which would have hurt the contract of Melgen-controlled company. Menendez, now serving his second full term as senator, led the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee from 2009-2011. During a Senate subcommittee hearing in 2012, Menendez didn't mention ICSSI, Melgen's company, by name, but he did press Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Matthew Rooney about an unnamed company who had a contract to X-ray cargo that went through all Dominican ports -- a contract that, he said, Dominican authorities \"don't want to live by.\" \"If those countries can get away with that, they will,\" the senator said. \"And that puts American companies at a tremendous disadvantage.\" Menendez's office said at the time the senator's interest was based on his efforts to combat narcotrafficking in the region. Other lines of inquiry against Menendez had included  allegations he solicited prostitutes in the Dominican Republic, and that he violated the law helping win permanent U.S. residency for two Ecuadorian banking magnates, the Isaias brothers. The prostitution allegations collapsed after the purported prostitutes recanted their story, and the FBI didn't find evidence of wrongdoing in the Isaias matter, according to people briefed on the probe. The FBI probe has already spawned a legal battle between the government, Menendez and his former aides. Last week, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals briefly posted, apparently by accident, documents detailing legal efforts to block certain evidence and testimony the government wants to use. The documents were quickly put back under seal, but not before a reporter with the New Jersey Law Journal secured a copy and later published a story. According to the documents, Menendez's lawyers have sought to claim emails and testimony from aides is protected by the constitutional protections given to members of Congress in carrying out their duties. The speech and debate clause prohibits questioning of members of Congress about \"legislative acts or the motivation for legislative acts.\" The fight centers in part on the Justice Department's attempt to compel testimony from Menendez's aides, some of whom have refused to answer questions to a grand jury. According to the documents, the government wants to question aides about a series of 2012 calls and meetings on Melgen's fight with the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a federal agency. Among these is a meeting among Mendedez, Sen. Harry Reid and then Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. The government is also pushing to use emails between Menendez's office and a CBP official about the Dominican ports issue. A federal district court ruled in favor of the government to compel testimony from Menendez's aides, but the appeals court reversed the ruling and ordered a hearing. \"The parties primarily dispute the legislative character of Senator Menendez's two conversations with [then acting CMS administrator Marilyn] Tavenner and his meeting with Secretary Sebelius,\" the appeals court said. \"These communications are not manifestly legislative acts because they are informal communications with executive branch officials, one of whom was at the time a presidential nominee whose nomination was pending before the United States senate.\"", "answer": ["An announcement from the Justice Department could come in weeks .\nCase will be a test of ability to prosecute sitting lawmakers ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "San Rafael, California (CNN)At 74 years old, Marilyn Price still remembers the first time she rode a bike. \"My father let go of my seat, and there I was on my own,\" she said. Years later, Price realized the power of biking to change lives. During a 1982 mountain biking trip in northern California, Price reached a point on the trail where she could see all of San Francisco. Looking out at the city, she thought of the children she met while volunteering at a soup kitchen there. And it hit her: She wanted to give them the same experience. \"There's nothing like biking up a mountain and looking behind you to see all you've accomplished,\" she said. Price has since helped more than 25,000 at-risk children from the San Francisco Bay Area get off urban streets and into nature through her nonprofit, Trips for Kids. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for CNN Heroes 2015 . In addition to mountain bike excursions, the group provides bike mechanic training and the chance for young people to earn credit toward their own bikes. Today, Trips for Kids has expanded to 90 chapters around the world, serving more than 15,000 children each year. See more CNN Heroes . CNN's Allie Torgan spoke with Price about the impact of her efforts. Below is an edited version of their conversation. CNN: For many of the young people in your program, this is their first time on a mountain bike. How do they react? Marilyn Price: Many of them have never really left the city. To them, life is automobiles and buildings. Everything is concrete. But you bring them where there are no buildings, no cars, it is like, \"Wow!  I didn't know that this exists.\" I think we're planting a seed that there are alternatives to getting into trouble. They can get on a bike and go to a place that is very much unlike where they live and do something positive. It's giving them the notion that there is something else. CNN: And their experience goes beyond bike trips. What else do you offer? Price: The second is our Earn-a-Bike program, where kids in the community come after school. They learn bike mechanics, and while they're participating they are earning credit. They can use it to buy bikes or parts. They're buying bikes for themselves, for their parents or siblings. I just love the idea of having them work toward a goal. They're really learning skills that will help them in the future. The third (program) is our bike thrift shop, where anyone in the community can come shop for a discounted bike. We call it Trips for Kids Re-Cyclery. All of the bikes and bike gear are donated. It provides 60% of what we need to run our programs. And it is 100% an environmental program. We follow the three 'Rs' very rigorously: reduce, reuse and then recycle! CNN: Trips For Kids has grown well beyond San Francisco. Why do you think this model works so well? Price: It's easy to use the bike to introduce kids to the environment because the bike is universally loved by children. The bike allows us to introduce them to a healthy lifestyle and good work habits. (It's) a tool to impart these life lessons. Right now there are 90 chapters, literally around the world, that are repeating our experiences. They all do bike rides and then some of them, as they get more developed like we did, also start their own Earn-a-Bike programs or their own bike thrift shops to support themselves. CNN: Did you ever imagine your simple idea would have such an impact? Price: I wear my Trips For Kids T-shirt wherever I go. I went into the bank one day here in Marin County, and there was a young girl who was the teller. She looked at my T-shirt, and she said, \"Wow -- you're with Trips For Kids? That was the best experience I've ever had. I will never forget it.\" I don't know how many stories there are like that, but it's planting that seed. I just love every minute of it. Seeing the results of what we were accomplishing just had me stick with it. Since I started the notion, I haven't given up and hope to continue forever.

The charity, which owns 500 historic homes and gardens, is worried that rooms often have ‘so much stuff’ it puts off all but the middle classes. The National Trust, which owns 500 historic homes and gardens such as Cliveden House in Buckinghamshire, is worried that exhibitions often have ‘so much stuff’ it puts off all but the middle classes . In an attempt to try to broaden the appeal of Britain’s grand properties, bosses yesterday launched a ten-year strategy that includes plans to ‘simplify’ some exhibits. Dame Helen Ghosh, director general of the National Trust, said simplifying the exhibits may be necessary. ‘We are making visitors work too hard in some places,’ she said . ‘It’s not surprising given that where we have come from, that the type of places that we own are the places where the middle classes feel more comfortable, that it forms more of their cultural background. ‘Our analysis is that it isn’t the entrance fee that is putting people off, it is that they think this isn’t “the place for them” So how do we get them in?’ The Trust's director general Dame Helen Ghosh, said places like the Carrick-a-Rede bridge attracts visitors from all social classes . Dame Helen, who was Permanent Secretary of the Home Office until she was appointed to the Trust in 2012, said that some properties have a broader appeal. ‘When you go to somewhere like Carrick-a-Rede in Northern Ireland and watch people walking over the rope bridge, they are from every socio-economic background, wearing shorts, flip flops, all of that,’ she said. But many of the large stately homes have a far narrower visitor base. The Trust is to experiment with simplifying the exhibits at some of its properties. Dame Helen said: ‘When it comes to our big grand houses one of the things we have to look at is the sheer number of exhibits. There is so much stuff in there. ‘Let’s not expect our visitors to look at every single picture in a room - let’ s pick one lovely thing, put it in the middle of the room and light it really well. ‘Let’s just have six or seven of those things dotted around that anybody would love - it’s not difficult. ‘We make people work fantastically hard - we could make them work much less hard.’ But she denied that the Trust is ‘dumbing down’ its approach in order to boost visitor numbers. ‘In many ways it is much more intellectually rewarding,’ Dame Helen insisted. ‘People will learn much more by looking at one object in a lot of detail, than they ever would going round a room getting a vague impression.’ Tim Parker, chairman of the Trust, added: ‘Every museum and gallery has the middle class problem. ‘We have serious aspirations to broaden our appeal - but the worst thing we can possibly do is to semi-condescend a group of people in order to a property seem more attractive.’ The National Trust is also putting a renewed emphasis on the great outdoors in the spirit of its founder Octavia Hill, who campaigned to provide open spaces for the poor. As part of that goal it is working as a consultant body with councils in Sheffield, Manchester and Coventry, to look at new ways to maintain and fund urban parks. The Trust hopes to use its experience in establishing endowments - the funding model that it uses to conserve many of its historic houses - to help set up new funding models for green city spaces. Although the Trust is not putting in any money to the schemes, other charities such as the Heritage Lottery Fund and Nesta are also involved. Mr Parker, a businessman who recently took over as chairman from outspoken journalist Sir Simon Jenkins, said outdoor space is a key way to broaden the Trust’s appeal. ‘The fantastic opportunity for the Trust is that we are not confined to buildings - we have lots of parks - people don’t have to go inside,’ he said. ‘We can do lots of things to make the whole offer that we have appeal not just to people who are in their 50s and 40s but people who are in their 20s and 30s as well. It is an age thing, not just a class thing.’", "answer": ["National Trust launches ten-year strategy for Britain's stately homes .\nScheme to attract more visitors includes plans to ‘simplify’ exhibits .\nCharity says exhibits make many feel like it is not 'the place for them'"], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "Red Bull Racing have launched their 2015 Formula One car race livery for the upcoming season as they hope to recapture their titles. Their new 2015 RB11 car has been used in F1 testing with a camouflage livery in order to ward off rival teams attempting to copy their design secrets. Red Bull won consecutive Drivers' and Constructors titles between 2010-13 but relinquished their crowns to a dominant Mercedes and Lewis Hamilton last season. Red Bull Racing have tweeted this picture of their 2015 RB11 car with this season's livery, which is back in their usual team colours . The new colour scheme was displayed on the team's Twitter page with the hashtag '#BackInColour' as Red Bull returned to their usual look. The most notable shape change to the 2015 car is the lower nose box and front of the chassis, which were amended in line with the latest regulations. Drivers Daniel Ricciardo and Daniil Kvyat have been putting the camouflaged RB11 through F1 testing in Catalunya but have managed a staggering 397 less laps than reigning champions Mercedes on the track as they look to close the gap. The 2010-13 Constructors champions hope their 2015 RB11 car can help the team reclaim the title off last year's champions Mercedes .

{"question": "It has been a multi-million pound rescue mission lasting 12 years, but 900-year-old Cardigan Castle, in Wales, is set open its doors to visitors once more in April. Tens of thousands of people are expected to flock to the historic castle, to see the results of the Cadwgan Building Preservation Trust project. It is set to be a lavish affair, with 3,000 daffodils and 1,700 rolls of turf planted in celebration of the occasion. Cardigan Castle is set to open in April, after an £12m renovation. It is hoped that the Castle will become one of west Wales’ top tourist destinations, attracting at least 33,000 visitors in the first year . The castle, which has been unoccupied since 1996, will open its doors to visitors in April, following an extensive £12m restoration project which began in 2011 . The new lease of life for the castle includes the recreation of the paths and lawns of the regency gardens, a  glass restaurant with panoramic views over the River Teifi, and the restoration of the whalebone arch – a popular feature for early 19th Century gardens. The impressive landmark has a fascinating history, from being build as a wooden Iron Age settlement by Gilbert de Clare in 1100, to enduring medieval battles between Normans and Welsh rebels, and hosting Wales' first Eisteddfod in 1176. The last inhabitant was Barbara Wood, who sold the castle in 2001 after residing there for almost 60 years. The redevelopment of the site has included the recreation of the paths and lawns of the Regency gardens and the fitting of a floor-to-ceiling glass restaurant . In 1165, The Lord Rhys and his Welsh army captured the castle and Cardigan became the first town in the country to be occupied by the Welsh . The design of some elements of the stone castle were inspired by the crusades and are the earliest examples of this work in the UK . The summer will feature events including an open-air theatre to music concerts, and fascinating exhibitions which tell the story of Cardigan, the castle, the people who lived there, and its role as the birthplace of the Eisteddfod . The castle was purchased by the council in 2003 and began being repaired as part of the regeneration of Cardigan by the CBPT charity. Jann Tucker, chair of CBPT, who was recently awarded an MBE for her efforts in preserving Welsh heritage, said: 'It's been a long time coming but the finishing post is nearly in sight. We have worked so long and so hard for this. 'The Castle will really put Cardigan on the map.' Through extensive refurbishment, and many hours work from numerous volunteers, the derelict site has been transformed into a high-end heritage attraction, luxury accommodation, restaurant and wedding and events venue. The renovation has transformed the house, previously inhabited by Barbara Wood, and restored the building for guests. Barbara was the last person to live in the castle and moved to the site as a young girl in July 1940 . Situated on raised ground overlooking the River Teifi, the site of Cardigan Castle has been an ideal location for thousands of years. This was confirmed by archaeologists in 2012 when Neolithic flint scrapers were unearthed in the castle’s grounds . Cardigan Castle has seen many battles over the years. A lesser known siege took place in 1138 when the Welsh attacked the Norman base with the help of Viking mercenaries . Cris Tomos, Castle Director, said: 'We're busy putting the finishing touches in place and are looking forward to opening ahead of the May bank holidays and summer school break. 'And there's plenty to attract visitors to the Castle over the summer months, with an exciting programme of events, from open-air theatre to music concerts, and fascinating exhibitions which tell the story of Cardigan, the Castle, the people who lived here, and its role as the birthplace of the Eisteddfod.' Funding for the grand project came from the Heritage Lottery Fund (£6m) and European Regional Development Fund (£4.3m), with the rest provided by other council and heritage trust funds. The grand opening will be Wednesday 15 April 2015.

{"question": "It brings new meaning to the phrase 'shark attack'. While most people will be familiar with images of seals being violently smashed out of the water snatched in the jaws of a shark, it appears some are exacting their revenge on the ocean predators. Scientists have reported multiple cases of cape fur seals attacking blue sharks off the coast of South Africa. Scroll down for video . Scientists have reported multiple cases of cape fur seals attacking blue sharks and eating their guts off the coast of South Africa. Diver Chris Fallows captured this image. The behaviour has left marine biologists baffled as to why the seals have turned to attacking the torpedo-shaped sharks . The seals, which are normally prey for great white sharks, have been seen attacking and killing medium-sized blue sharks, devouring their guts before leaving the rest of the carcass. Divers also report seeing the fur seals attacking other species of shark and rays. The behaviour has left marine biologists baffled as to why the seals, which normally hunt smaller fish, have turned to attacking the torpedo-shaped sharks. The blue sharks are around the same size as the seals and it is thought to be the first time a seal has been seen preying on such a large predator. It was first observed by marine photographer Chris Fallows, who runs a dive boat operation from Cape Town in South Africa. Dr Neil Hammerschlaf, a marine biologist at the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Astmospheric Science who was involved in the study, said the seals appear to be eating the guts of the sharks as they contain the most energy. The blue sharks are around the same size as the seals and it is thought to be the first time a seal has been seen preying on such a large predator. An expert said there are relatively few reports of pinnipeds, or seals, preying on sharks in general, and in all cases these involved smaller sharks . Blue sharks, like the one above, are one of the ocean's top predators with a sleek body and mouth full of teeth. Dr Neil Hammerschlaf, a marine biologist at the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Astmospheric Science said the seals appear to be eating the guts of these sharks as they contain the most energy . He said this behaviour may have serious implications for blue sharks, as their numbers are already in decline due to over fishing. 'Seals are generally considered prey of larger sharks,and blue sharks have been observed pursuing juvenile and adult male Cape fur seals, though no kills have been witnessed,' he continued. 'There are relatively few reports of pinnipeds (seals) preying on sharks in general and in all cases these involved smaller sharks. Cape fur seals, like the one pictured, normally use their manoeuverability to prey upon smaller fish and squid. Scientists believe that the seals could also be attacking the sharks partly to remove competition for the fish they normally eat . 'The consumption of large sharks by a Cape fur seal is a departure from the prevalent view of this species’ diet, which is generally reported to consist of a diverse diet of small fish species, cephalopods and birds. 'The prevalence of the behaviour reported here is unknown - it could reflect opportunistic predation by a generalist predator or it might be a common tactic. 'These observations are important not just for understanding the interactions between these two species but more broadly for their implications in understanding the trophic ecology of pinnipeds - many populations of which have increased while numerous shark populations have declined.' Length: Males typically grow up to 7.5ft (2.3 metres) Weight: Males weigh 440 to 660lbs (200 to 300kg) Weapons: Large canine teeth, powerful jaws and claws . Normal prey: Mainly fish but also about a fifth of their diet is squid and sometimes crabs . Behaviour: They can live up to 30 years and then to gather in small groups but will often swim alone. They can dive as deep as 200 metres (650 feet) and stay underwater for seven minutes. They are commonly attacked by great white sharks, which attack them from below, and killer whales which hunt them in packs. Length: Females grow between 6 to 9.3ft (1.82 to 2.82 metres) Weight: Females weigh 205 to 401lbs (93 to 182kg) Weapons: Multiple rows of triangular serrated teeth . Normal prey: Bony fish,  cuttlefish, octopus, shrimp and crabs . Behaviour: Their sleek body shape makes them fast and efficient swimmers, allowing them to snatch their prey out of the water. Blue sharks live for up to 20 years, are known as an open water species, and often migrate long distances. They are preyed upon by  larger sharks like the great white and tiger shark. Fur seals have been known to mob great white sharks in large numbers but this is thought to be a defensive tactic to scare them away from breeding colonies. In this case the fur seals have been observed attacking the blue sharks, which are open ocean predators that can grow to be about 9ft long (2.82 metres), on their own. Mr Fallows, who runs Apex Expeditions, first noticed the behaviour in 2004 while on a dive off Cape Town. Fur seals are common prey for great white sharks, which snatch them in their jaws from below (above). Fur seals will often group together and mob these sharks, but this is thought to be a defensive tactic . In 2012 he again saw a large Cape fur seal attack five blue sharks from a shoal of ten over a two hour period. The sharks were estimated to measure between 3.6ft (1.1 metres) and 4.5ft (1.4 metres) in length. Mr Fallows said: 'They swim up to them and grab them. There is no protracted chase. 'It is almost as though the sharks are not expecting this to happen and do not overly react to the seals advances. 'We have seen them feeding on three other small species of sharks. We have also observed them feeding on rays. 'I would think it is possibly a learned behaviour based on limited normal food availability.' A study on the behaviour is now published in the African Journal of Marine Science. Scientists believe the seals could be attacking the sharks partly to remove competition for the fish they normally eat. Dominic Tollit, a marine mammal consultant with the Sea Mammal Research Unit in Canada, told New Scientist that attacking such a large and heavily armed predator is a high risk strategy if simply looking for food. He said: 'Would you attack a lion if you're hungry, or would you go for something smaller?'", "answer": ["Scientists report cape fur seals have been attacking and killing blue sharks .\nThe unusual behaviour was spotted by divers off the coast of South Africa .\nThe seals themselves are usually hunted and killed by great white sharks .\nBlue sharks are about the same size as fur seals but mainly eat smaller fish .\nThe seals were seen to pounce on the sharks and then eat only their guts .\nThis is thought to be the most energy dense part of the shark for the seal ."], "label": "SUM"}

A New Orleans judge has approved an order of protection, preventing Durst from contacting his brother Douglas, head of family business Durst Corp, and other members of Douglas' family. The former real estate heir was arrested this week on charges related to the murder of his long-time friend Susan Berman, who was killed execution-style in 2000. Prosecutors have charged Durst with capital murder, making him eligible for the death penalty if convicted. Scroll down for video . Robert Durst's (left, in mugshot taken Saturday) family has taken out a restraining order against him, in the wake of his recent arrest on murder charges. Durst's brother Douglas pictured on the right in November 2014. In the state of California, murder convicts can only be eligible for the death penalty or life in prison without parole if prosecutors prove that the murder was carried out with a 'special circumstance'. In Durst's case, the alleged special circumstances include killing a witness and lying in wait. Last year, California's death penalty was deemed unconstitutional, but the state will likely appeal the decision. The last time a California death row inmate was executed was in 2006. Durst, 71, was recently the center of HBO documentary The Jinx, and in the final episode which aired Sunday, appears to confess to killing multiple people when he thinks the audio on his microphone is off. But Los Angeles Police say his Saturday arrest has nothing to do with the recording. The latest protective order prohibits Durst from communicating with brother Douglas, his wife Susanne, their children Helena and Alexander, as well as their respective spouses and children. According to documents obtained by TMZ, Durst must stay away from their offices and homes - something he has had difficulty doing in the past.

LAPD say his arrest on Saturday has nothing to do with the show . In April 2013, Durst was arrested for lurking outside of his brother's house. The Jinx follows Durst's long fued with his younger brother Douglas, who father Seymour named head of the multi-billion-dollar family corporation. In the wake of Durst's arrest, Douglas issued a statement on behalf of the family which reads: 'We are relieved and also grateful to everyone who assisted in the arrest of Robert Durst. We hope he will finally be held accountable for all he has done.' In addition to the death of Susan Berman, Durst has been linked to the disappearance of his wife Kathleen in 1982, and the homicide of his elderly neighbor Morris Black. Durst was acquitted of Black's murder after claiming he killed and then dismembered the neighbor out of self defense. He is currently being held without bond since he is considered a flight risk.

{"question": "The progress Liverpool have made since that defeat at Old Trafford in December has been nothing short of remarkable. They remain the only unbeaten team in the Barclays Premier League this year and it owes much to the solidity of a defence now boasting six straight away games without conceding a goal. Clearly, it amounts to a tactical triumph for manager Brendan Rodgers. Not least in the way he tore up his own blueprint for life without Luis Suarez and came up with an entirely new strategy that has worked for the players who remain at Anfield. That is no easy task, as Roberto Martinez and Louis van Gaal would probably testify. Simon Mignolet dives to spectacular deny Swansea's Gylfi Sigurdsson during Liverpool's 1-0 win on Monday . Emre Can has slotted in well in defence after Brendan Rodgers changed his system . Brendan Rodgers (left), Colin Pascoe (centre) and Mike Marsh talk tactics on the Liverpool bench . Liverpool have not lost in their last 13 games - a run that has seen them rise from 10th in the table to fifth. Should they beat Swansea on Monday then they will be just two points off fourth place. D - 2-2 Arsenal (H) W - 1-0 Burnley (A) W - 4-1 Swansea (H) D - 2-2 Leicester (H) W - 1-0 Sunderland (A) W - 2-0 Aston Villa (A) W - 2-0 West Ham (H) D - 0-0 Everton (A) W - 3-2 Tottenham (H) W - 2-0 Southampton (A) W - 2-1 Man City (H) W - 2-0 Burnley (H) W - 1-0 Swansea (A) But watching Liverpool at Swansea on Monday night, their success in stopping their hosts from scoring was down to more than the clever deployment of certain players. Yes, there is no doubt the decision to move Emre Can into a back three - when he was signed principally as a midfielder – was quite brilliant. Can has been superb in the role alongside Martin Skrtel and Mamadou Sakho, who have also benefitted hugely from a tactical reshuffle that appears to provide them with more security and with it greater confidence. The decision to drop Simon Mignolet earlier this season has also proved an astute piece of leadership by Rodgers. How a player responds is of the utmost importance and Liverpool’s goalkeeper, much like we saw with Joe Hart at Manchester City, has returned with greater focus and determination. Against Swansea he made some marvellous saves, in particular to deny Bafetimbi Gomis and Gylfi Sigurdsson. That said, Liverpool’s defence also demonstrated against Swansea that they remain prone to the occasional mistake. There was a moment at The Liberty Stadium, which led to the Mignolet save to deny Gomis, when a neat exchange of passes between Swansea’s French striker and Wayne Routledge left a gaping hole in Liverpool’s back three. In the press box we do not have the benefit of Jamie Carragher and Gary Neville’s tactical analysis but I can imagine one of them might have highlighted that on their super-duper tactics board at half-time. This is where Liverpool have also been riding their luck a little; a luxury teams sometimes enjoy when they have a bit of momentum and something that was illustrated further by the nature of Jordan Henderson’s winning goal. Jordan Henderson (right) scored Liveprool's winning goal after a lucky deflection . But football teams often make their own luck and the truth is their success in defending their own goal in recent weeks goes way beyond good organisation and some fine individual performances. It points to the fact that Liverpool, having started the season so poorly, are working doubly hard to get back into contention for the Champions League places. They are defending as a team, with players tracking back tirelessly from midfield to rescue their colleagues when mistakes are made. Neil Taylor tested Can on Swansea’s left flank but it was Henderson who was there to make one important interception, even if the challenge was a little over-zealous and earned the England midfielder the first yellow card of the night. When Gomis burst past Skrtel later in the game, it was Joe Allen who was there to cut out the shot. Desire and determination are important qualities at this stage of the season and Rodgers declared his side’s ambition to finish second again this season in the knowledge that these players want it every bit as much as he does.

Martin Skrtel (left) is proving himself a leader at the back of a much improved Liverpool defence . Yes, the defenders look more assured. Yes, Skrtel is proving himself a leader in the Liverpool defence. Against Swansea he was outstanding, even producing the initial pass that led to Henderson’s goal. And yes, Sakho and Can are now playing to the level we have long come to expect of Liverpool defenders. But they are working as a team, and playing with more composure after Rodgers realised the more cavalier approach they employed when Suarez and Daniel Sturridge were terrorising defenders just wasn’t working this season. The statistics make interesting reading. Only five Premier League goals conceded in 10 games in 2015 compared to 25 in the 19 they had played before the turn of the year. But it’s as much down to hard graft as the intelligence of Rodgers. And while the deployment of Gerrard as a holding midfielder, and with it a slight change to a diamond formation, gave Henderson the freedom to get further forward last night, it was the mere fact that Henderson was fit enough and determined enough to make that run in pursuit of Sturridge’s flick-on that earned Liverpool their goal.

{"question": "A dog walker who spent two years thinking he owned a £100,000 piece of rare whale vomit has discovered the pungent rock is actually worthless. Ken Wilman thought he had found 'floating gold' when he stumbled across what he believed was a 3kg lump of the highly sought-after ambergris on the beach in Morecambe, Lancashire. But his dream of netting a small fortune has now been shattered after an expert in the U.S revealed the 'stone' is not authentic ambergris - and has absolutely no value. Scroll down for video . Ken Wilman, 52, thought he had discovered a £100,000 piece of rare whale vomit when he found this yellow-grey rock washed up on the beach in Morecambe, Lancashire, while working his dog Madge . An expert in the U.S believes that the pungent  rock has absolutely no value and is not authentic ambergris . Ambergris, or 'grey amber', is the intestinal slurry of sperm whales, which they eject into the ocean - usually when they have a stomach or throat problem. The substance can then float around undiscovered for years in the water, where it hardens and develops into a smooth lump of compact rock which feels waxy and has a sweet smell. It is this aromatic quality which makes it is used in perfumes such as Chanel Number 5. Mr Wilman said: 'If I had my time over again, I would kick the rock to one side and walk away. I wish I'd never found it. I've got to accept what happened and get on with it.' The 52-year-old was walking his boxer dog Madge along the beach in January 2013 when he stumbled across what he believed to be the rare item. The highly sought-after Ambergris, or 'grey amber', is the intestinal slurry of sperm whales, which they eject into the ocean - usually when they have a stomach or throat problem (file picture) Ambergris is the intestinal slurry of sperm whales, which they eject into the ocean - usually when they have a stomach or throat problem. The substance can then float around undiscovered for years in the water, where it hardens and develops its distinctive odour. The decades of floating and exposure to sun and salt will then turn the matter into ambergris, a smooth lump of compact rock which feels waxy and has a sweet smell. It is that quality which means it is highly sought-after with perfume makers, who use it to prolong the scent of perfume. Although ambergris is still an ingredient in perfumes today, producers usually remove it from their product because of the legal ambiguities surrounding its use. As it comes from sperm whale, which is classed as a vulnerable species, cosmetic companies tend to shun using it because it is associated with whaling. But the sweet-smelling sick has been used in a variety of other ways throughout history. Ancient Egyptians reportedly found a use for it by burning ambergris as incense. The country still uses it today for scenting cigarettes. During the Black Death in Europe, worried people also thought they could thwart the plague by carrying a ball of ambergris because the vomit masked the smell, which they thought was the root of the illness. It is rarely found on British beaches, usually being washed up in America and Australia. A French dealer offered him 50,000 Euros if it turned out to be real, while some experts said it could be worth double that quote. But the true value of the stone was discovered when documentary maker Peregrine Andrews -- who produced a Radio 4 show called Ken, Madge and the Strange Rock following the find - sent a sample to an expert across the Atlantic. Christopher Kemp, an American author who wrote a book about ambergris, then broke the news that it was definitely not whale vomit. To add to Mr Wilman's heartbreak, his beloved dog has also passed away since he made the discovery. Mr Andrews said: 'He (Christopher Kemp) emailed me back and said it's definitely not ambergris, although he didn't know what it was. 'Then I had a text from Ken telling me Madge had died. He was in complete shock and then I had to tell him it wasn't real ambergris.' Mr Andrews has since contacted a dealer in New Zealand who has promised to send Mr Wilman a 2g piece of real ambergris. Although it is virtually worthless, Mr Wilman is delighted at the gesture. He said: 'When Peregrine told me, I nearly broke down. I cant believe there are nice people in the world, like this lady, who feels sorry for me and wants to send me a piece of ambergris. 'I've kept a level head about things and I'm trying to find humour in the situation.' Although it is rarely found on British beaches, eight-year-old Charlie Naysmith discovered a 600g piece after taking a stroll along Hengistbury Head, near Bournemouth in 2012. Beachcombers Sean Kane and, 24, and Ian Foster, 39, also discovered a 110lb of whale vomit washed up on the beach in Criccieth, North Wales, in 2008. In 2006 a couple walking on an Australian beach found a 32-pound chunk of ambergris, which netted them $295,000 (£155,000).", "answer": ["Ken Wilman found yellow-grey rock while on the beach with his dog Madge .\nHe thought  3kg lump was the sought-after ambergris from sperm whales .\nBut U.S expert said the rock, found in Morecambe, Lancs, is not ambergris .\nA dealer in New Zealand is sending Mr Wilman, 52, a 2g piece as a gesture ."], "label": "SUM"}

The boss takes his Barclays Premier League thoroughbreds to Sunderland on Saturday for a crunch clash. The Black Cats are a point and a place ahead of fourth-bottom Villa, who themselves are just three points above the drop zone. Tim Sherwood hopes the Premier League relegation battle does not end up being a photo-finish . And with the Cheltenham Gold Cup on Friday, Sherwood is hoping Villa, who have never been relegated from the Premier League, can avoid being unseated. He said: 'I think it'll be a photo finish and I hope we're not in it. 'We're probably just coming around the corner but it's probably the longest run-in in racing history. 'All we're looking at is the next fence and that's Sunderland. After that we hope we can stay in the running. There might be a few who fall along the way and we're hoping that's not us.' Villa have won their last two under Sherwood, beating West Brom twice in the league and the FA Cup to reach the semi-finals.

{"question": "A Los Angeles-based artist claims Versace has ripped off one of her designs. Kesshia 'KESH' Kumari, who has more than 80,000 Instagram followers, used the social networking site to express her views about the luxury fashion house. She uploaded a picture of one of the T-shirts she created with American Apparel inspired by her artwork in 2013 next to Versace's offering, which she captioned: 'At least make it better than the $30 (£20) original @versace_official. This looks like a first draft.' She also uploaded a snap of Versace's £440 Medusa cotton jersey T-shirt and wrote: 'This.hurts. $650.versace rip off. sold out in 3 sizes. what is this madness? from huge designer labels to small boutiques to giant pop stars to fame hungry former friends. what is this? 'Why can't these companies. these brands. these people create their own work? what happened? why do these people think that everything that they lay their eyes on instantly belongs to them? (sic)'. MailOnline has contacted Kesshia Kumari for comment. In an interview with The Cut, the London-born designer said: 'I have always had a deep admiration for Versace. It’s an iconic brand that has stood the test of time. I am deeply disappointed in this. 'This is not only artwork from a show that took me two years to develop and create. It is not only artwork from a collection that I created for American Apparel to provide something affordable and accessible to supporters of my work. ' But this is also my face! I can’t understand how something like this could happen.' Kesshia Kumari, who is of Malaysian and Trinidadian heritage, began designing her graphic creations 17 years ago and began selling them on MySpace. The Versace T-shirt's description on Selfridges website reads: 'Versace’s flair for contemporary prints can be seen with this statement t-shirt. Crafted from cotton-jersey and featuring Medusa’s head printed on the front, simply team with jeans for a luxe off-duty look.' MailOnline has contacted Versace for comment. Speaking to MailOnline, Jim Dennis, an intellectual property partner at law firm Gordon Dadds, the English member firm at Globalaw, said: 'Kesh’s design is certainly distinctive and the Versace design is strikingly similar. Provided Kesh’s design is original, then under UK law it will attract copyright as a graphic work. 'It is for the Court to decide whether Versace has copied Kesh’s design but the similarities between the designs are so substantial the Court may readily infer that copying has taken place. If so, Versace would infringe Kesh’s copyright unless they can prove with clear evidence that they created their design independently and without reference to Kesh’s. If they are found to infringe then they may be liable for damages to Kesh or have to hand over their profits from sales of the offending t-shirts.' Carissa Kendall-Palmer, associate solicitor, EIP in London, added: 'In short, Kesh should be filing a law suit right away. The Versace T-shirt is clearly very similar to the T-shirt she developed for the American Apparel range in 2013. On the face of it, Kesh has a good case, but will need to gather evidence to support it. 'The design could be protected by both design rights and copyright, and it certainly looks like a bit of a rip-off. Many fashion brands rely heavily on these unregistered rights and at times, it can be complicated and expensive to prove their case. She is not on her own here. Copying is very common in the industry. 'There is always the possibility that Versace has a good excuse but it will take some explaining. Copyright infringement is criminal, and if Kesh registered her design, copying that is also a criminal offence under the new 2014 laws.

{"question": "Choosing the perfect ski destination can be a tricky prospect. Especially if you want to take your family. The first instinct is to think about the Alps. But if you want to go away in February half-term - which we did - then the snowiest parts of France, Italy and Austria can be busy. And a little expensive. We happened upon an alternative. Norway. Fill your snow boots: Norway can be an inexpensive alternative to the Alps . The slopes are snow-sure well into April, prices are reasonable and families are exceptionally well catered for. My wife and I have two children, Maisie, five and Imogen, three. That's young to start skiing, but I was told that Trysil would do the trick. After an easy transfer from Oslo airport, we arrived at the Radisson Blu, one of two ski-in ski-out hotels. There is ten-pin bowling, an American-style diner, a soft play area and a vast multi-pool swimming area that would prove to be a huge hit with my lot. It is also right by the nursery slopes - our first morning found us riding the magic carpet to ski school. Maisie was in a class of five, Imogen was with three others. And by a happy quirk, they were being taught by two sisters, both delightful. By the second day, she was riding the mini drag lift and Imogen was padding around on her skis, searching for stuffed toy lions and monkeys around the kids area. Easy does it: Trysil can be a perfect ski destination for families with young children . By the end of the week, both were skiing better than I could have hoped. Trysil has four main ski areas, all with excellent nursery slopes - with easy routes down from all points. The ski school also runs a drop-in creche from 10.45am to 3pm for £8 an hour per child, with a 30 per cent discount for siblings. We used this for our own ski time. The slopes are surprisingly extensive. Hogegga is an area with mostly black runs - and new for this season is the first of a series of new gladed trails through woods. Skihytta is a charming mountain hut serving its own beers, and moose shot by the owner. Knettsettra is another must-visit mid-mountain restaurant and bar. It hosts free concerts for up to 5,000 people in March and April. The one sting in the tail is the cost of alcohol. A draft half-litre of beer cost me £6.50 and a bottle of wine £35. But the well-priced food balanced this out over the week. And it was not just about the skiing. Downhill all the way: Trysil has slopes for skiers all abilities, within quick reach of Oslo . We also took the girls dog-sledding across a beautifully scenic plateau, and our highlight of the week was a horse sleigh ride with a stop-off in a Nordic yurt to cook hot dogs over an open fire. The girls definitely developed a taste for skiing, and we have a new love affair with Trysil. We are already thinking about going back for half-term next year. Roll on February 2016. Ski Safari (01273 224 068, www.skisafari.com) offers holidays for a family of four (two adults, two children) from £3,100, based on a seven-night stay at the 4*+ Radisson Blu Resort on a half-board basis - including flights and transfers.

Her $90,000-a-year job was meant to be an administrative role at Gordon's home in LA, organizing his diary, the Post reported. However, in court documents seen by DailyMail.com, she claims she was used to 'essentially babysit' as Gordon went 'partying, drinking, and consuming various illegal drugs each night... as well as regularly engaging strippers and prostitutes.' Gordon rejects Bluemner's claims and says that she stole $1,200 from his credit card at the Apple store . 'Used': Bluemner's lawsuit claims she was used to help Gordon pick up women .

{"question": "An armed robbery of  an 18-wheeler truck transporting bars of gold from Florida to Massachusetts was most likely an inside job, according to police. The $4.8 million gold heist by three armed robbers unfolded after one of the two armed guards  said that he felt sick and prompted the driver to pull over. But Wilson County Sheriff Calvin Woodard Jr. said Wednesday that different stories have emerged about the trip from Bridgewater, Massachusetts on I-95. Scroll down for video . Investigation: Wilson County Sheriff Calvin Woodard Jr, pictured, said that differing stories from the guards about the armed robbery had led to suspicions over their accounts of heist . Suspects: Woodard shared sketches of the suspects thought to be male and possibly Hispanic who allegedly bound the hands of the driver and the passenger - there are three suspects altogether . White van: Two security guards working for Transvalue Inc of Miami were reportedly approached by three armed men driving a white van, pictured here, after pulling over on the interstate . In the latest account of events, one of the two armed guards said that he felt sick and this is why the driver pulled over. However, in an earlier description the guards,  employed by Miami-based company, TransValue Inc. said a mechanical issue had caused the driver to stop. The guards said that after the vehicle stopped they were approached by three armed men driving a white van who ordered them to lie on the ground. They then tied their hands behind their backs and marched them into nearby woods before taking 275lbs of gold. Woodward told reporters that these differing accounts have led to further investigations. 'There is suspicion at this time that this could be an inside job due to the circumstances of the robbery,' a Wilson County Sheriff's Office detective wrote in a search warrant obtained by ABC. 'The fact that the truck was robbed immediately upon it pulling over at an unannounced stop is suspicious in and of itself,' the document added. Search: Armed robbers are suspected of stealing $4million in gold from an 18-wheeler taking the precious from Florida to Massachusetts on Interstate 95. Above, deputies investigate a wooded area near the road . Location: The men 'ordered the guards to lie on the ground, tied their hands behind their backs and marched them into nearby woods, before taking 275lbs gold' Cone: This photo is of a traffic cone that was positioned behind the truck as suspects allegedly removed gold from the vehicle after breaking a lock on the back . 'It is also suspicious because there are no markings on the side of the truck that would indicate the type of cargo contained therein. 'The suspects also went directly to the trailer and found the gold which was in unmarked five gallon buckets. It is not believed that this is a random act due to the nature and facts of this robbery.' Police are now seeking a search warrant for the phones of the armed guard who felt sick because of the suspicious nature of the case. Woodard shared sketches of the three suspects who allegedly bound the hands of the driver and the passenger. Meanwhile, a photo was shown of a traffic cone that was positioned behind the truck as suspects allegedly removed gold from the vehicle after breaking a lock on the back. The traffic cone had the marking of a company that only does work in Florida, according to ABC. Woodard said the driver and the passenger, who speak little English, are not suspects, but both men have been interviewed separately several times by police. He added that the driver and the passenger did violate their company’s policies by exiting the vehicle without their firearms and leaving the firearms inside the truck. Wilson County Sheriff's Deputies investigate an area near Interstate 95 in Wilson, North Carolina, on Monday . Investigation: The Federal Bureau of Investigation has joined in the search for the robbers, thought to be male and possibly Hispanic. Neither of the guards was injured during the 'very rare incident', TransValue said .

{"question": "Alexandra Walkden, 62, was left virtually toothless after her dentist of 30 years failed to provide proper treatment for gum disease . A grandmother claims she was left 'looking like Nanny McPhee' after 13 of her teeth fell out due to dodgy dental treatment. Alexandra Walkden, 62, was left virtually toothless after her dentist of 30 years failed to provide proper treatment for gum disease. Her grandchildren likened her appearance to the screen governess with magical powers played by Emma Thompson. As a result, she was forced to pay £24,000 to undergo painful surgery for dental implants. Now Mrs Walkden, a telesales worker from Preston, Lancashire, has won £35,000 damages in an out of court settlement after taking legal action against the dentist, Dr John Musgrave, 57. She said: 'I had to have surgery to remove 13 teeth and eventually have implants fitted. 'I looked like somebody who had been in a car crash. I had black eyes, swollen mouth and I couldn't eat for a week. It's ruined my life. I don't want this to happen to anyone else. 'My grandchildren would call my Nanny McPhee when I didn't have my dentures in because I had just one tooth at the top.' Mrs Walkden had been a patient of Dr Musgrave at the Preston-based Incisive Dental Practice for 30 years and attended dental appointments with him every six months. She said: 'During these years I didn't think anything was wrong. I'd get the all clear. 'Or I would say I was having problems and he would say he would have a poke around and say its fine and to see him in six months. 'If there were problems or a tooth was twinging, he would look at it or find a cavity and say it needs filling. I trusted him implicitly. Whatever he said, I believed. She added: 'As far as I know he did a routine check but he never told me I had gum disease. He never offered for me to see a hygienist.' The truth emerged during a holiday in 2013 with her partner when Mrs Walkden's crown fell out and she went to see a local dentist. To her horror, it emerged her teeth were rotting from the inside out. She said: 'When I went to see him the first thing he said was \"when was the last time you went to the dentist?\". 'When I said \"3 months ago\", he said \"that's not what your teeth are telling me\". 'I was completely shocked. We cut our holiday short and came home. 'I went to another dentist close to home and they confirmed I was going to lose all my top set of teeth.' 'You can't imagine the reaction when someone tell you they will have to take all your teeth out. It was horrible. 'They asked if I wanted to sit down.. It was a feeling that was absolutely horrendous. I had 13 teeth removed. 'I also had a wisdom tooth on the bottom removed that was beyond saving and had to have an implant to replace that wisdom tooth.' Despite paying for regular private dental treatment for 30 years, Mrs Walkden was horrified to be told by another dentist that her teeth were rotting from the inside out - and the top row would need to be removed . Her grandchildren likened her appearance to Nanny McPhee, the screen governess with magical powers played by Emma Thompson. Mrs Walkden, had to endure a number of deep cleaning treatments to treat the gum disease before all but four of her top set of teeth were removed. She said: 'I had to go through a few treatments of that. I have never experienced pain like that before as they clean beneath the gum line - it's very high powered. It was like torture but it had to be done. 'Then I went to have my teeth extracted, all but 4 at first. They fitted me there and then with a partial denture.' 'I had to get used to something so alien in my mouth and learn how to speak again as it changes the shape of your mouth. I didn't want to be left with dentures for the rest of time.' Mrs Walkden eventually underwent implant surgery in April 2013 and had to go to the dentist every week. She said: 'I have spent hours at the dentists and thousands of pounds and I have only been left with around £11,000 for pain and suffering. 'Compensation is not a \"pay out\". No amount of money can compensate for having lost my teeth. 'The money I've received will be used to cover the thousands of pounds I have paid out of my own pocket for all the necessary remedial and cosmetic work. 'If I weren't fortunate enough to have been able to fund my treatments while the case was being fought, I don't know what state my mouth would be in right now.' She added: 'This is all because this dentist didn't do proper checks. If he had done X-rays he would have known. It is basically negligence. 'I put the time in going to the dentists and I expected to be taken care of. If you look at the dentists records you see check-up after check-up every 6 months. You just don't expect to end up going through this.' 'I felt utterly betrayed by Dr Musgrave when I found out the extent of the damage to my teeth and gums. 'I've worked hard all my life to pay for extra things in life like private dental insurance and have never missed a dentist appointment. Mrs Walkden was forced to pay £24,000 to undergo painful surgery for dental implants. She has now won £35,000 damages in an out of court settlement after taking legal action against the dentist, Dr John Musgrave . She said: 'If I weren't fortunate enough to have been able to fund my treatments while the case was being fought, I don't know what state my mouth would be in right now' 'I thought I was taking good care of my teeth and assumed that my dental insurer would have taken steps to screen its members. It was wrong to assume that my dentist's inclusion on the insurance register was a quality guarantee. 'It ruined my confidence. In that situation you just don't want to go anywhere - it's horrendous. It does nothing for your confidence and leaves you very self-conscious.' Associate solicitor, Heather Owen at the Dental Law Partnership which represented Mrs Walkden said: 'Alexandra's case was one of long-term mistreatment, compounded by a string of failures by her dentist Dr Musgrave. 'He routinely failed to check the health of her teeth, screen for gum disease, remove decay or even carry out appropriate preventative care. 'At no point was the patient advised of alternative treatment options or referred to specialists when her oral health started to decline.' Dr Musgrave, who did not admit liability, refused to comment.", "answer": ["Alexandra Walkden, 62, from Preston, was left virtually toothless .\nHer dentist of 30 years failed to provide proper treatment for gum disease .\nWas forced to pay £24,000 to undergo painful surgery for dental implants .\nHas now received £35,000 in out-of-court settlement but is still angry ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "(CNN)Australia lodged a formal complaint Friday over the treatment of two drug smugglers sentenced to death in Indonesia during their transfer to an island where they are expected to face execution. During the transfer, a senior Indonesian police officer was pictured in photos with the Australian pair on a flight. Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan were being taken from Kerobokan prison in Bali to Nusakambangan island in Central Java, where they will be held in a maximum security facility before facing a 12-man firing squad. The date of the execution is not yet known, although the convicted will be informed at least 72 hours before they are put to death. Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs said it had lodged a formal complaint with the Indonesian embassy in Canberra over the treatment of the prisoners during the transfer, which took place before dawn on Wednesday. Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop told Australian media that an undue show of force, including armored vehicles and dozens of officers in helmets and balaclavas, was also used during the transfer. \"I just cannot comprehend it. They are two men who are described by their own prison governors as model citizens, two gentlemen who pose no risk to anyone,\" she told the ABC's AM program. \"I cannot comprehend the manner or the method of their transfer to the so-called execution island.\" A spokesman for Indonesia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the photos were taken without the consent of the officer involved,  Commissioner Djoko Hari Utomo. \"The officer was inquiring about the physical condition of Mr Chan,\" Arrmanatha Nasir told CNN in regard to one of the images. \"It is regretful that this photo is being used by the media to portray something more than what it really is.\" Australia's complaint comes after Indonesia dismissed a last-minute proposal to save the pair's lives through a prisoner swap. Nasir told CNN that there are no Indonesian laws that would allow or provide for an exchange. \"Indonesia does not have legislation or laws or any other legal instruments that will enable the issue of a prisoner exchange to be conducted,\" he said, adding that the Australian government had been informed of this stance. Sukumaran and Chan, members of the so-called \"Bali Nine\" smuggling ring, have been held by Indonesian authorities for nearly a decade. They are expected to be held in a maximum security facility on Nusakambangan where they will be isolated before being put to death. They are among a number of people from different countries who are also scheduled for execution. Australian government and opposition parliamentarians attended a candlelight vigil at dawn Thursday, as a spectacular sunrise lit politicians from across Australia's political spectrum, united in opposition to the impending executions. \"We appeal to the Indonesian president to grant a stay of clemency,\" Bishop told the gathering. She reminded the Indonesian government that legal avenues remained open, before appealing for mercy on behalf of the convicted men's families. \"I've spoken to the families. They are going through an unimaginably difficult time and I ask that you think of the families who are praying that their son, brother, grandson can have their life spared. We appeal again to President Widodo, the leader of a strong and proud country, to show mercy and forgiveness and spare the lives of these two young Australians.\" Australia has repeatedly appealed for clemency for the pair. They have been jailed since April 2005 for a failed bid to smuggle more than 8 kilograms of heroin from Bali to Australia. OPINION: Why executions won't win Indonesia's drug war . Prime Minister Tony Abbott said people should not let anger affect Australians' relationship with Indonesia. \"We abhor drug crime, but we abhor the death penalty. We think that these two Australians deserve to be punished, but they certainly don't deserve to be executed,\" he said. The Bali Nine were arrested after Indonesian police received a tip from Australian Federal Police. Chan, 31, was called the ringleader of the plot, and Sukumaran was described as Chan's collaborator in the scheme. Seven other people who participated in the plan are serving lengthy prison sentences. Police caught four people at the Denpasar airport with more than 8 kilograms of heroin strapped to their bodies. Another four -- including Sukumaran -- were arrested at a hotel in the village of Kuta. Chan was detained after a boarding a plane to Sydney -- he wasn't carrying any drugs but was named by others as the mastermind of the plot. The Indonesian administrative court last week dismissed a case filed by lawyers of the two Australians against President Joko Widodo. The attorneys wanted a review of the president's decision to deny them clemency. Todung Mulya Lubis, who represents the pair, said a challenge had been submitted to the administrative court and lawyers were still waiting for a court summons. \"There should be no execution as long as there is a legal process going on,\" Lubis said. Sukumaran and Chan have become model prisoners during their time behind bars, according to fellow inmates and the jail's chief warden. Sukumaran is studying fine arts and has set up a class for fellow inmates. Chan has found spirituality, which he uses to counsel inmates with drug problems. Their rehabilitation is genuine, Bishop has previously said. \"Andrew and Myuran are the model of what penal systems the world over long to achieve,\" she told the Australian Parliament in February. Indonesia has long taken a tough line on drug smugglers, and Widodo has made it clear he doesn't intend to introduce a policy of leniency. In December, six prisoners were killed by firing squad, including five foreigners from Brazil, the Netherlands, Malawi, Nigeria and Vietnam. Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff issued a statement saying the execution of one of her countrymen had \"severely affected\" relations with Indonesia.

{"question": "Victor Valdes says he can have no complaints about sitting on the bench at Manchester United as he regards his rival David de Gea as the best goalkeeper in the world. Louis van Gaal won the race to sign Valdes in January, but his only appearances in a United shirt so far have come in the Under-21 side. Despite being a three-time Champions League winner, Valdes is yet to turn out for the senior team simply because De Gea's form has been nothing short of outstanding. Victor Valdes (right) says his compatriot and team-mate David de Gea (left) is the finest keeper in the world . The former Barca man admits he doesn't mind warming the Old Trafford bench if De Gea is No 1 . Valdes bears no ill feeling towards his fellow Spaniard though. He can only marvel at his performances. 'You are always waiting for your opportunity to play and train every day to show your performance to the manager,' the former Barcelona goalkeeper told United Uncovered. 'But now David is at a very, very high performance level. 'I think he is the most important goalkeeper in the world at the moment. So it is difficult [for me] to play and, of course, I must accept this. 'For me, the top [keeper] now is David. I see him every day in training. I watch him in every game, every week, and his performances right now are amazing.' Negotiations have begun between De Gea and United over an extension to his current contract, which expires next year. Negotiations have begun between De Gea and United over an extension to his current contract . If they are unsuccessful, Real Madrid will surely pounce to sign the 24-year-old, whose Madrid-based girlfriend Edurne Garcia made it clear that she is not a fan of Manchester this week. Valdes, 33, will have a tough job on his hands winning over the fans if he replaces De Gea in goal next season. 'Every week he makes saves to help the team so I am very happy for him and also for the fans,' said Valdes, who is contracted until the end of next season. 'I always hear them sing the song of David de Gea, so I think they are very happy with David for the level of performance he has shown in the last few years. I feel the fans are definitely very happy with the job he is doing.' De Gea's latest impressive display came on Monday when he prevented Alexis Sanchez and Santi Cazorla from making United's FA Cup exit to Arsenal even more painful. One of the few times De Gea has been upstaged this season came on December 28 when Hugo Lloris pulled off a number of excellent saves to earn Tottenham a 0-0 draw against United at White Hart Lane. United management team Louis van Gaal (left) and Ryan Giggs face the test of Tottenham on Sunday . De Gea still put in a top performance in north London, and on Sunday he is likely to be busy once more when Spurs come to Old Trafford thanks to Harry Kane's form. Van Gaal, a sincere believer in youth development, has been impressed by the fact that Spurs academy graduate Kane has scored 26 goals in his breakthrough year with the club. 'The way [Kane] is scoring is a reason for their success,' Van Gaal said. 'That's one aspect of the world of football that a big talent can stand up in one season and he is doing that. 'I like the process in Tottenham because there also you can see that a lot of experienced players are not playing and a lot of youngsters are playing. Old Trafford boss Van Gaal identified the scoring sensation Harry Kane as a factor to Tottenham's success . 'In spite of that they are also very close (to the top four) and are playing attacking football. 'I like Tottenham. It is not easy to play Tottenham. 'They have a lot of talent . 'I hope we can beat them because it will be very difficult again.' Sunday's game marks the start of a tough run of fixtures for United, who then face Liverpool, Aston Villa, Manchester City and Chelsea. The Red Devils are fourth in the table, just two points in front of Liverpool and three ahead of Spurs. Van Gaal will be without Robin van Persie on Sunday as he remains sidelined with an ankle injury. Jonny Evans and Angel di Maria are suspended while Marcos Rojo is a doubt due to a groin problem.

{"question": "London (CNN)The handwritten checklist looks like something any teenaged girl might make ahead of a vacation trip:  makeup, bras, underwear, boots, an epilator. But this list was apparently made by the three UK schoolgirls suspected of traveling from London to Syria to join ISIS, according to Britain's Guardian newspaper, which has seen the document. The girls' families told British lawmakers Tuesday they had no idea what the girls were planning, and said they were baffled by the teenagers' decision to leave their homes and families. The three East London classmates -- Shamima Begum, 15; Kadiza Sultana, 16; and Amira Abase, 15 -- boarded a Turkish Airlines plane from London's Gatwick Airport to Istanbul on February 17. They are thought to have crossed the Turkish border into Syria within days. Relatives also had harsh words for police, who they said failed to keep them informed after a close friend of the girls headed to Syria in December. Amira Abase's father, Hussen Abase, told lawmakers at a hearing of the Home Affairs Select Committee that he had no idea his daughter was planning to go or that she might have been radicalized. Sahima Begum, the older sister of Shamima Begum, said her sister had been into \"normal teenage things,\" like watching \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians,\" reading and playing games on her phone. There was nothing to indicate she was radicalized, she said. Fahmida Aziz, first cousin of Kadiza Sultana, said that if the family had spotted any signs of radicalization, \"we would have been very effective in stepping in and querying\" that thinking. She also said she had no idea how her cousin accessed the money needed for the trip. Committee chairman Keith Vaz said it was \"every parent's nightmare that this should happen\" and said he could only imagine the families' distress and anguish. Who are the missing UK girls? The families' criticism of law enforcement hinges on a February 5 letter from the police which was given to the three girls to give to their parents, rather than being sent directly to the parents. The families claim they were not told about a 15-year-old friend of the girls going to Syria weeks earlier -- and say that had they known, they might have been able to prevent their daughters from traveling too. Metropolitan Police Chief Bernard Hogan-Howe apologized for his officers' failure to get the letter directly to the parents, in his testimony before the committee. But he also pointed out the difficulties for police in conducting what was at that time a missing person inquiry for the first girl who left, with no sign that these three were planning to follow suit. Hogan-Howe said police were reviewing their procedures in light of what had happened. Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley told the committee there was a \"steady flow\" of girls trying to travel to Syria, perhaps one or two a month. He said subsequent police investigations indicated the three girls had paid in cash for their plane tickets to Turkey at a local travel agency, using money linked to the theft of jewelry from their families. None of the girls was reported missing until several hours after the flight had left for Istanbul. However, the families' lawyer asked how they had managed, as minors, to board the flight without being challenged. CCTV footage also later showed that the girls spent much of the next day waiting at a bus station on the outskirts of Istanbul -- raising more questions about why they were not spotted then and whether UK police had communicated effectively with Turkish authorities. Rowley said that two people have been arrested in relation to child abduction in relation to the first girl who went missing, who has not been named. Asked how the UK might be able to get the girls back, Rowley cited an incentive: As long as they're not connected to terrorist offenses, they'll be able to return to their families. Rowley said police have no evidence that the girls have been involved in terrorism-related activities, and if that remained the case, they wouldn't be treated as terrorists upon their return. Who has been recruited to ISIS from the West? The list was reportedly found in the bedroom of one of the girls and handed to police after her family realized she was missing. It detailed items to buy, such as underwear, a mobile phone and cosmetics, and estimated travel costs, apparently totaling £2,190 ($3,296). The biggest single cost was the three plane tickets to Turkey, the newspaper said, at just over £1,000. The list, written on a page from a diary planner, had initials indicating which of the girls was to buy what or who the items were for. It's not clear where they would have gotten the money to meet the costs. Over the weekend, the girls' families asked for an apology from London's Metropolitan Police over the force's handling of the case. The police said in a statement Saturday that after the first girl went missing in December, a police officer spoke to seven of her school friends at Bethnal Green Academy -- including Shamima, Kadiza, and Amira -- as potential witnesses who might have information about the missing girl. A deputy principal at the girls' school was present for the meeting and afterward contacted the parents of the seven girls, on the advice of police, and told them that the girls' friend, referred to only as \"Girl 1,\" had been reported missing. An officer who then spoke to the same group of girls on February 5 gave them the letters addressed to their parents asking for further help from their daughters, the police statement said. But not all the letters were passed on. \"With the benefit of hindsight, we acknowledge that the letters could have been delivered direct to the parents,\" the police statement said. \"However, the parents were already aware from the Deputy Head that Girl 1 had been reported missing, all the teenagers were all being co-operative, they were all being treated as potential witnesses and there was nothing whatsoever to indicate that they themselves were planning to travel to Syria.\" What is ISIS' appeal for young people? Days before they left for Turkey, at least one of the girls allegedly contacted a young woman, Aqsa Mahmood, who left her home in Scotland to travel to Syria in 2013 and is accused of trying to recruit others via social media. She has posted tips for girls and young women wanting to travel to Syria to marry jihadis, as she did. Her blog also has links to advice posted by another jihad supporter, which recommends that those traveling to Syria seek to pack the essentials but not too much, since they may need to move often and at short notice, while remaining inconspicuous.

{"question": "Ricky Haruna (pictured) whose duties included guarding Kate Middleton, said she was fired from the Met Police after complaining about racism . A decorated female police officer who sued Britain's biggest police force for racial discrimination after claiming she was called a n***** by a colleague has won her case and will return to work. Ricky Haruna, 39, whose duties included guarding Kate Middleton, said she was fired from London's Metropolitan Police last June after complaining about racism and launched a case for harassment and wrongful dismissal. She is now returning to duty after an appeals tribunal backed her claims. PC Haruna was sacked from the force after what she called a 'malicious arrest' over an alleged fraud, one of three claims which led to her dismissal, and which she was later cleared of. She told the tribunal the Met only took disciplinary action against her because she pursued the racism complaints. She said: 'There was no evidence on which any reasonable, unbiased panel would have dismissed me.' The racist abuse started in 2010 when a suspected shoplifter called her 'midnight' - a racist term used in South London. She said instead of supporting her other officers present 'appeared to laugh'. She added she did not receive support from senior officers when she told them a colleague called her 'a n*****'. She said: 'After that I was harassed and ­ victimised by racist police officers and those that support and cover up for racists in senior management.' She also said she was excluded from a staff Christmas dinner, telling the tribunal: 'I was the only black police officer and only female police officer based in that office at the time and I felt singled out and picked on.' She was sacked seven years after she was pictured alongside Kate Middleton - then Prince William's girlfriend - and who she regularly escorted.

She saved the lives of two people during her career and was awarded two commendations.

{"question": "If you like the idea of having a conversation with your pet cat then you better look away now. Flam, a cat in Nashville, Tennessee, may well be the first of its kind to have had a conversation with a human being. But sadly, as documented on video, the little chat didn't go down that well with the feline. In the clip is Penny Adams, a professional photographer who volunteers her time at the Cat Shoppe Rescue centre. Sitting on the floor, she announces to the camera that she is holding a cat-to-human language translator on her phone. Penny, who doesn't herself know what it is being translated by the app, activates the meowing sound and immediately Flam, who sits underneath a table, becomes noticeably intrigued. Penny announces to the camera that she is about to use a cat-to-human translator app on her phone . Jumping up, the feline negotiates a number of dumbbells on the floor before making its way towards Penny. With its tail poised, the cat maintains its eye-contact while lifting its paw and climbing up onto her leg. Suddenly it lashes out at her – opening its mouth to bare its teeth it strikes her with its paw. Intrigued, the cat approaches Penny with its tail poised and begins slowly climbing up her leg . Reacting by blocking the cat with her arm, Penny laughs in surprise as the insulted feline continues to bare its teeth before scuttling off. According to Penny, she had visited Kate Framke's home – Flam’s owner – to photograph her other cat  Waffles for a fundraising calendar for The Cat Shoppe. After struggling to get Waffles’ attention with toys and treats, Penny used her human-to-cat translator app as a way of getting the cat to look at the camera. The cat, clearly insulted by what the human-to-cat translator app is saying, attacks Penny with its paw . Penny said: ‘It worked, but it also got an unusual reaction from Flam, who proceeded to walk up slowly and pop me in the head. We laughed so hard.’ She added: ‘Who knows what the app was really saying in cat voice, but he sure didn't like it.’ The Cat Shoppe is Nashville’s first feline-friendly shop that sells a number of cat-related products and also runs a non-profit cat rescue centre.

{"question": "A suspended Roman Catholic priest who authorities say dealt pounds of methamphetamine and bought a sex shop to possibly launder his drug money is asking a federal judge for leniency when he is sentenced next week. Monsignor Kevin Wallin's public defender filed a sentencing request in federal court in Hartford on Monday citing Wallin's three decades of charitable service as well as more than 80 letters of support, including one from the late New York Cardinal Edward Egan. Wallin, 63, dubbed 'Monsignor Meth', pleaded guilty in 2013 to a methamphetamine conspiracy charge and agreed to a potential prison sentence of 10 to 11 years. Kevin Wallin, 63, dubbed 'Monsignor Meth', pleaded guilty in 2013 to a methamphetamine conspiracy charge and agreed to a potential prison sentence of 10 to 11 years . Already imprisoned for the past two years, he is now asking for a sentence of no more than four years in prison followed by a year of home confinement, 500 hours of community service and drug treatment. Sentencing is scheduled for March 24. 'The record evidence demonstrates that Kevin Wallin is an extraordinary man whose remarkable character and acts have touched thousands of people,' Wallin's public defender, Kelly Barrett, wrote in the sentencing request. 'Kevin tragically became a methamphetamine addict. He fell from grace and did criminal wrong, but has confessed his crimes and has been working hard to atone for them.' Barrett wrote that Wallin's numerous accomplishments include serving as pastor of St. Peter's Parish in Danbury and the Cathedral Parish in Bridgeport, volunteering with a variety of community groups, helping found an AIDS ministry program, leading an inner city charity group, serving on the Danbury Cultural Commission and serving on the board of directors of Sacred Heart University. Egan, who died earlier this month, was bishop of the Diocese of Bridgeport from 1988 to 2000. He praised Wallin in a letter to the court. Wallin bought the Land of Oz & Dorothy's Place adult video and sex toy shop in North Haven and had apparently intended to launder drug proceeds . 'He was outstanding in the fulfillment of his assignments and in his concern for people in need,' Egan wrote. 'Father Wallin was held in highest regard as a dedicated clergyman and an outstanding citizen as well.' Federal prosecutors say Wallin committed serious crimes and most people convicted of conspiring to sell meth are sentenced to at least 10 years in prison. Federal investigators said Wallin had associates in California send him methamphetamine beginning in late 2008 or early 2009. By 2011, Wallin's partners were sending him one to three pounds of meth a month and Wallin was running the drug operation out of his apartment in Waterbury, investigators said. Wallin also bought the 'Land of Oz & Dorothy's Place' adult video and sex toy shop in North Haven and apparently intended to launder drug proceeds that totaled in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, federal agents said in court documents. Wallin served as the pastor at St. Augustine's in Bridgeport for nine years before taking a sabbatical in 2011 for health and personal reasons . Wallin's two accomplices in California — Chad McCluskey of San Clemente and Kristen Laschober of Laguna Niguel — were both sentenced last year to five years in prison. Two men who helped Wallin sell drugs in Connecticut also were convicted. Kenneth Devries of Waterbury was sentenced to more than two years in prison and Michael Nelson of Manchester awaits sentencing. Brian Wallace, a spokesman for the Diocese of Bridgeport, said Wallin is still a priest, but remains suspended from public ministry. 'We're asking for prayers for him, understanding and recognizing that many people ... suffer from addiction and they lose control of their lives,' Wallace said. 'It's time for him to try to rebuild his life.'", "answer": ["Kevin Wallin, 63, dubbed 'Monsignor Meth', pleaded guilty in 2013 to a methamphetamine conspiracy charge .\nHe agreed to a potential prison sentence of 10 to 11 years, but has asked a federal judge for leniency when he is sentenced next week .\nAlready imprisoned for the past two years, he is now asking for a sentence of no more than four years in prison followed by a year of home confinement .\nWallin bought the Land of Oz & Dorothy's Place adult video and sex toy shop in North Haven and had apparently intended to launder drug proceeds ."], "label": "SUM"}

Tech blogger Kenneth Tsang extracted all the movies and TV shows on offer in each country and put them in a spreadsheet, finding 1,116 titles in Australia compared with 8,499 in the U.S. A Netflix spokesman said the libraries vary from country to country, adding that they change every day. 'Our aim in Australia is not to replicate the American library,' he told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Netflix has officially launched in Australia but its local offering carries 7,000 fewer titles than its U.S. version . 'As our library grows, we're collecting data and we can tailor our content as we spend more time in market because we understand what Australians are watching.' The spokesman added that content distribution deals prevented Netflix from carrying certain titles in Australia. 'That's purely down to distribution rights, many programs get snapped up by other services. 'Our goal is to work towards a global model, when that happens we will be negotiating rights on a global scale.' Mr Tsang also found that Netflix has 693 titles available only to Australian viewers.

{"question": "He's better known for his fancy footwork on the pitch but Liverpool and England striker Daniel Sturridge took time out of scoring goals to get some kitchen action. The 25-year-old Birmingham lad was taken through his culinary paces by his mother Grace, who taught him how to make her favourite dish ahead of Mother's Day. And like her Reds son, mum Grace is a fan of healthy eating and requested the Kop ace to create a high protein meal of spicy grilled chicken with seasoned quinoa and vegetables. Scroll down for video. Daniel Sturridge and kisses his mother Grace after he successfully cooks spicy chicken with quinoa and vegetables as part of his Mother's Day Challenge . The 25-year-old Birmingham lad in action on the pitch, competing with Alex Baptise of Blackburn Rovers during the FA Cup Quarter Final match on Sunday 8 March . The duo joined forces in the kitchen as part of a Sainsbury's Active Kids event at a school in St Paul's RC Junior School, Liverpool. Daniel, who cooks his own meals every day, told FEMAIL: My mum is amazing, she has provided me with so much support and continues to do so always. 'To spoil my mum I would probably cook her something healthy with a bit of spice to it, fish based maybe. 'Mum loves nice salads and especially avocado, so would definitely include that.' For the challenge the Sainsbury's Active Kids ambassador had to prepare quinoa -  which is a superfood favourite of the family - and marinate the chicken with Grace's home-made spicy 'Sturrcrazy' sauce, made to a secret family recipe. The pair cook together when they can although these days it's becoming rarer. Grace said to FEMAIL: 'When we can we like to cook together, but it doesn't happen so often these days, as Daniel lives away from home. Mother and son work together and start off by seasoning the chicken with a mixture of spices . As the chicken marinades the pair chop the vegetables and prepare the rest of the meal . What was Daniel like as a child? Daniel has always been really active, he played football in and out of school. At home he would play out whatever the weather! Because of his naturally active lifestyle, he always loved meal times and eating Afro-Caribbean food. As our family were all sporty and active, it was natural for us to promote healthy eating and a healthy lifestyle. Does he still have the same tastes? Yes still loves it, amongst other things! But Daniel loves anything with spice to it. What is his favourite food? I would say he has two favourite dishes, fish and chicken. The white meat is full of protein so is really good for him and he loves to be able to make both chicken and fish in to spicy dishes, which is why he loves our family's Sturr Crazy sauce. If he was cooking for you, what would he cook? Probably salmon with sweet potatoes and garlic thyme chopped up and cooked in the oven. It's quite an easy dish to make and it's really tasty. He would probably make a side salad with rocket, tomatoes and lots of avocado, he knows I love avocado! What does Daniel mean to you? All of the family are so proud of what Daniel has achieved so far, he gave up so much as a child and we are just so happy that he is achieving his dream, as parents you couldn't wish for more than that for your children! But she still tries to get her family together at weekends. 'Every Sunday we still try and get together as a family and have a typical Afro-Caribbean lunch of spicy meat, rice and peas. 'We love getting together and think it's important to spend that time together,' she continued. Famous for being a proponent of superfoods after his 2014 calf injury saw him miss 13 matches, Daniel now incorporates as much nutrient-packed foods into his diet as he can. 'It's important for me to make sure that I eat a healthy balanced diet as obviously I'm training every day,'he said. 'I do enjoy cooking and I look forward to my dinner each night.' His favourite meal to cook is 'salmon, kale, sweet potato, broccoli and quinoa' which he covers in Sturr Crazy sauce. 'I have it on everything,'he said. 'It adds that perfect amount of spice to a dish; I even took some out to the World Cup with me.' A typical day will see him pack away three scrambled eggs with berries for breakfast whilst lunch and dinner are heavy on protein-rich foods . 'Lunch and dinner could be quite similar to each other with something like quinoa, with perhaps chicken or fish [as] they are both great for recovery and full of protein,' he said. 'On the side I would have broccoli, spinach, lots of steamed veg. I also drink a lot of white tea and moringa tea throughout the day,' he continued. So far so healthy, but doesn't he have any guilty food secrets? 'I'm pretty good with my diet to be honest, I love healthy food which helps and it is something I have worked on for years. But every now and then you need something sweet, which is fine, but all in moderation,' he said. And does he dance in the kitchen when he's successfully cooked a meal? 'Haha I leave the dancing for on the pitch,' he laughed. Tara Hewitt, Head of Sponsorship for Sainsbury's said: 'It was great to see Daniel and Grace cooking together at the event; they clearly have a passion for great tasting, healthy food.' Result! Daniel and Grace with the finished meal, spicy chicken served with quinoa and steamed veg . Ingredients: Four chicken thighs (skin and boneless); 220g quinoa; four spring onions; one sweet red pepper; two cloves fresh garlic; four medium carrots; one broccoli floret; four spears of asparagus; black pepper, all spice, paprika; dark soy sauce; olive oil . Mehod: Season the chicken with all spice, black pepper, paprika and dark soy sauce and leave to marinate overnight. Pre-heat the oven to 400*F and back chicken for approx 30 mins until golden and cooked through. Splash on some SturrCrazy sauce (or other spicy condiment) and return to the oven for five minutes. Rinse the quinoa thoroughly and place on a high heat with a pinch of salt. Bring to the boil then turn down to simmer for 20 mins until steamed and fluffy then set aside. Whilst the quinoa is steaming, finely chop the onions a quarter of the sweet pepper, two cloves of garlic and pan fry with a splash of olive oil, pepper and season all. Empty and toss the cooked quinoa in with the onions and mix together, adding more seasoning if needed.

{"question": "Relentless Robbie Neilson  celebrated Hearts clinching the Championship title in March — then ordered his team to smash Hibs’ second-tier record points total. An unexpected 2-0 win for Rangers at Easter Road yesterday left the Tynecastle side — who had beaten Falkirk 3-0 at Westfield 24 hours earlier — an unassailable 23 points clear of Hibs with 21 points left on the board. Neilson learned his team had secured a return to the Premiership without kicking a ball while he was studying for his pro licence at Stirling University yesterday afternoon. Robbie Neilson wants his Hearts team to surpass Hibernian's second-tier points total . Hearts ended up securing their title a day after a 3-0 win against Falkirk . Rangers beat Hibernian to give Hearts an unassailable advantage at the top of the league . But, despite the league being finally in the bag, the 34-year-old vowed there will be no let-up as Hearts hope to usurp Hibs’ record tally of 89 points, set under Alex McLeish in 1999. Should his team rise to his challenge of winning their remaining seven matches, the rampant Gorgie outfit would end the season with a remarkable 99 points. ‘It’s a fantastic achievement to win the league. It’s a great day for the club,’ said Neilson. ‘The objective for the season was to get promoted. We’ve done that and that will give us a head start in planning for next season — but we need to keep winning games. ‘We’ve got seven games left and we want maximum points. We won’t be losing focus. If we could set a new record for points for the division, then that would be fantastic. ‘When you play for a club with the stature of Hearts, you have to keep winning games — and that’s what we need to do. ‘I will rotate the squad and some guys will get game time but you have to win games. We can’t be turning up at venues and losing games. We want to win, starting with three more points against Queen of the South at Tynecastle next weekend.’ Neilson believes his side’s 2-1 stoppage-time win at Ibrox against Rangers on the opening day of the season set the tone for a fine campaign. But it wasn’t until a battling 2-1 victory at Queen of the South on February 21 that he truly believed his side was destined to win the league and return to the top flight after one season away. ‘I don’t think you ever take things for granted until you are over the line,’ he said. ‘But I think that Queen of the South game was a big one for us away from home. We went a goal behind and we had to fight back to get all three points. We eventually got there and, from then on, I thought we had a real chance of taking the league. ‘But that win against Rangers on the opening day was a huge one for us in terms of morale and also for our fans. A lot of times you can go to Ibrox, go ahead and then Rangers draw level and you’re then hoping to hang on for a draw. Hearts' Genero Zeefuik celebrates after giving his side two-goal lead against Falkirk . The Hearts players celebrate as they beat Falkirk and edged closer to an impressive title win . ‘But we went straight up the park and scored again to get all three points and that set the tone for the whole season. It gave us a real belief we could go on to win the trophy and now we’ve done it. ‘To finally get over the line is magnificent. The players have worked so hard and I couldn’t have asked for more. ‘We can now speak to players we want to get from outside the club and speak to players at the club and try to renegotiate. We’ve got guys who have been fantastic for us and we want to keep hold of them. ‘It’s just a great day and it’s testament to the support we’ve had all season from the fans, the hard work of (owner) Ann Budge and (director of football) Craig Levein and all the players. ‘The fans in particular have been magnificent and they deserve to have a great night and a great few weeks.’ Meanwhile, Hearts captain Danny Wilson admitted it was a relief to finally get over the line after months of being billed as champions-in-waiting. Hearts captain Danny Wilson revealed his joy after his side became Scottish Championship winners . ‘It has been difficult, you know,’ he said. ‘Since maybe late December and early January people have had us installed as champions. So it’s been tough, not so much to keep your standards up but to put all that talk to one side. But we’ve done that. ‘The way the season has panned out, we’ve been going about our business in the right fashion.

{"question": "Ella Draper (pictured) and her partner Abraham Christie forced her two children to lie about sexual abuse and ritual torture . An evil mother tortured her children to make up sickening allegations about a satanic cult based at a primary school in the midst of a seething child contact dispute, a High Court judge ruled yesterday. Ella Draper and her partner Abraham Christie forced her two children to lie about sexual abuse and ritual torture in Hampstead, North London, Mrs Justice Pauffley said. She named and shamed the pair in a written ruling on care proceedings brought by a local council and said their internet campaign about the cult was ‘evil’ and ‘baseless’. The judge suggested the couple may have fed the two youngsters, aged eight and nine, cannabis soup to gain their compliance. More than four million people worldwide have viewed the ‘fantasy’ online material and police had to protect worried parents at the gates of Christchurch Primary School where the ‘main action’ was alleged to have happened, the ruling said. The ‘grotesque’ claims against ‘blameless’ people included drugged babies being sent from abroad by courier services such as TNT and DHL to London and then sacrificed. Cult members were said to have drunk their victims’ blood and danced around with the babies’ skulls. At least seven other schools were named, a swimming pool identified as a meeting place and ‘rituals’ were alleged to have been performed at a McDonald’s fast food restaurant. The children’s father Ricky Dearman, whose three-year relationship with Draper ended acrimoniously in 2006, was falsely said to be the leader of the cult, and teachers, police and a priest to be among its more than 100 members. The judge said: ‘Many of those individuals are now living in fear because they have been identified on the internet as abusers of children and their contact details including telephone numbers, home and email addresses have been published. ‘Several of those implicated have received malicious, intimidating phone calls and emails at all hours of the day and night from all over the world. For example – “We’re coming for you. You paedo scum”.’ The two children, who are now in care, were repeatedly named in the internet campaign and films of them uploaded to the internet ‘with flagrant disregard for their welfare interests’. Mrs Justice Pauffley was asked to investigate by social services bosses in care proceedings brought by Barnet council after the two children were said to be at the centre of the cult’s abuse. But the judge said they were in fact forced by Draper and Christie to ‘provide concocted accounts of horrific events’ in filmed mobile phone recordings and to lie to police when interviewed after the allegations were brought to the attention of officers in September last year. The children’s stories came about as the result of ‘relentless emotional and psychological pressure as well as significant physical abuse’. Internet campaign: More than four million people worldwide have viewed the ‘fantasy’ online material . ‘Torture is a strong word but is the most accurate way to describe what was done to the children by Christie in collaboration with Draper,’ the judge said. ‘Both P and Q have suffered significantly. Their innocence was invaded. Their minds were scrambled. Their grip on reality was imperilled.’ Tests showed they had both also ingested cannabis in the three months before being taken into care. It was impossible for analysts to say if this was via passive smoking or oral ingestion, but both children had described in interview how hemp was made into soup at their home using the juicer, the judge said. Draper took no part in the court proceedings and has ‘not been seen by anyone in authority since February 12’. There are ‘rumours that she has fled abroad’ because she fears being arrested, Mrs Justice Pauffley said. The judge completely cleared Mr Dearman and all others named in the campaign of any abuse and called the material published on the internet ‘nothing more than utter nonsense’. ‘I am entirely certain that everything Ms Draper, her partner Abraham Christie and the children said about those matters was fabricated,’ she said. ‘The claims are baseless. Those who have sought to perpetrate them are evil and or foolish. ‘All the signs are that those responsible for posting material derive a great deal of personal satisfaction from attracting interest to their spiteful work from many thousands of people. ‘It’s akin to the sensation, I imagine, of a Facebook user receiving an indication that some posting or other has been liked.’", "answer": ["Mother forced children to lie about sexual abuse and torture, judge rules .\nElla Draper and Abraham Christie were named in care proceedings ruling .\nMrs Justice Pauffley said the internet campaign  was ‘evil’ and ‘baseless’\nShe said couple may have fed children cannabis soup to gain compliance .\nMore than four million people have viewed the ‘fantasy’ online material ."], "label": "SUM"}

This is not Roy Hodgson’s fault. His players can only beat what is in front of them. Tottenham striker Harry Kane is set to make his full England debut against Italy on Tuesday night . Kane celebrates after scoring on his England debut against Lithuania just 79 seconds after coming on . Kane looks on as England manager Roy Hodgson talks to members of the squad at the Juventus Stadium . Yet just as Hodgson is trying to play down the clamour around Kane, playing down the euphoria around England’s present run may be equally wise. It is not a year since England’s poorest World Cup finals performance in recent memory and what we do know is that when a group of players that are the scourge of the Baltic nations plus an odd mountain range or two came up against Italy in Manaus last June, they did not have the wit to win. That is where Kane comes in. Italy and England may be depleted in Turin, but certain standards remain. Italy’s defence will be of a calibre England have not experienced since the World Cup. Their ambition will be greater than that of previous opponents, too. The Spurs striker headed in against Lithuania  shortly after coming on as a substitute at Wembley . Kane celebrates his first international goal as England cruised to a 4-0 win over lowly Lithunania . This is a genuine test for Kane, in a way his cameo role against Lithuania wasn’t. He will not have played against a team of Lithuania’s standard since he was being farmed out by his club on loan to gain experience. Lithuania fielded a starting back four featuring players from Rangers, Hapoel Haifa, Zalgiris Vilnius and Cambuur of Holland. On Tuesday, he will play against two of the men who have powered Juventus to the pinnacle of Italian football — Giorgio Chiellini and Leonardo Bonucci — plus Andrea Ranocchia of Inter Milan. It is an upgrade. And that is what England require of Kane, too: an upgrade. Hodgson knows he already has the players to qualify for a major tournament — but he didn’t have ones who could muscle past Italy or Uruguay once there. The hope is Kane could change that. Kane will come up against Italy and Juventus defender Leonardo Bonucci (left) on Tuesday night . Giorgio Chiellini (second right), pictured with his Italy team-mates, will also come up against the England man . Italy players train at the Juventus Stadium in Turin ahead of Tuesday's friendly against England . At the moment we are left asking questions to which we probably know the answer. Why is Danny Welbeck so prolific for England — Europe’s top scorer in the current qualifying campaign, no less — yet still finding his feet with Arsenal? Why is Raheem Sterling’s form so inconsistent for Liverpool, yet so vital for England? The explanation can be found in that Lithuanian back four. When does Welbeck get to play against defenders at the level of the Scottish Championship with Arsenal? When does Sterling face opposition such as Cambuur? Danny Welbeck, top scorer in Euro qualifying, celebrates with Wayne Rooney after scoring on Friday night . Raheem Sterling comes up against better quality opposition for Liverpool than when playing for England . Chelsea send their promising youth-team players to Vitesse Arnhem on loan, and they often make the first team. Vitesse are currently fifth in the Eredivisie; Cambuur are 10th. The last time they met, on February 4, two Chelsea players featured for Vitesse, who won 2-0. So that is what Welbeck and England were up against on Friday — defenders who might not quite be at the level of Chelsea’s best youngsters. Faced with John Terry in the Premier League, different rules apply. Yet against Terry on January 1, Kane nhad one of his best games of the season. Kane had one of his best games of the  season against John Terry during Spurs' 5-3 win over Chelsea . He is English football’s top scorer playing often against players with the quality we shall witness on Tuesday night. What Hodgson must be hoping is that in Turin he sees a player who can take England beyond. Wayne Rooney was Europe’s top scorer on the way to South Africa in 2010, too. Having qualified, England failed to attain the necessary level when competing in the finals. Hodgson talked of Kane on Monday as a squad player being given the chance to show what he can do — albeit with one of his most promising lines of supply severed as Sterling is back on Merseyside nursing a minor injury. Yet he is more than just that. If Kane demonstrates that he can pose a genuine threat to high- level defenders, he has the capability to change the way England approach matches. The Premier League's top scorer will be up against defenders of real quality when England take on Italy . Welbeck does a job for Hodgson, but that is what it is: a job. It is a good job — he is the player Hodgson relies upon when he is concerned the opposition has superior technique — but it has limitations. Welbeck works hard, he closes down, he has pace on the counter-attack — and he does exactly what the manager asks of him. And, for now, that is enough. Welbeck has been prolific as England power through the mediocrities. Welbeck does a good job and is often relied on by Hodgson when England face sides with superior technique . Extra is needed in France in 2016, however, if England are to be more than just present. Hodgson must discover match-winners, players who have the beating of contenders like Italy. So Tuesday night is much more than a friendly for Kane. This is a moment when he has the opportunity to alter the potential of English football and, if successful, we shouldn’t be frightened to embrace this.", "answer": ["Roy Hodgson has confirmed Harry Kane will start for England against Italy .\nKane scored first international goal on debut against Lithuania on Friday .\nEngland's recent winning streak has come against Europe's also-rans .\nThe Three Lions take on Italy at the Juventus Stadium on Tuesday night ."], "label": "SUM"}

When Thoronka, the country's number one 100m sprinter, left Sierra Leone for Glasgow, some Ebola cases had been confirmed in a few of the villages surrounding Freetown, but the epidemic had not yet taken hold of the capital. The death toll in the country is now more than 3,500 cases. The runner said: 'I was hoping to win a medal for my country.

{"question": "(CNN)It's the home of British politics, steeped in history, tradition and centuries-old pomp. But could the ornate splendor of the UK's Houses of Parliament be about to offer a solution to London's housing crisis? In all honesty, probably not. However, that hasn't stopped housing campaign group, Generation Rent, from proposing to transform the Palace of Westminster into affordable new homes. The group's eye-catching idea is to move the seat of British democracy from one of London's most exclusive neighborhoods to a new location in the city of Hull, northern England. The vacant House of Commons and House of Lords (the UK's upper legislative chamber) left behind would be converted into 364 flats of varying size and scale with prime office space facing the River Thames. According to a press release on the proposal from Generation Rent, 335 MPs from all over the UK currently rent second homes so they can carry out their parliamentary duties more effectively. They claim expenses for doing so cost the taxpayer £5.26 million ($8 million) in 2013 alone. By moving the seat of government to Hull, a city with the cheapest housing rent in England, millions could be saved in expenses as well as staffing costs, the group claims. Westminster is one of the most expensive boroughs for property in London, according to research from house moving firm, Delivery Quote Compare. The ever-rising cost of property in the UK capital, meanwhile, is making it increasingly difficult for many to buy or rent in central areas of the city. A January report from rental referencing company, Homelet, also found that average rental prices in Greater London were more than double that of those found in the rest of the UK . \"We hope our proposal gives MPs a sense of humility and some urgency to ending the housing crisis,\" said director of Generation Rent, Alex Hilton. Yet even if the Generation Rent proposals were seriously considered, they could come unstuck by the dilapidated state of the parliament building itself. Speaker of the House, John Bercow, said Monday that repairs needed to bring the nineteenth century structure up to scratch could come close to £3 billion ($4.6 billion). A 2012 study entitled \"The Restorations and Renewal of the Palace of Westminster\" found that the building could suffer permanent damage if work was not undertaken to stem leaks, repair crumbling stonework and remove asbestos.", "answer": ["UK campaign group proposes to transform Houses of Parliament into affordable housing units .\nWestminster is one of the most expensive boroughs of London for buying or renting property .\nParliament could require restoration work totaling $4.6 billion ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "Council worker Maria Spruce, 40, spent £3,500 of taxpayers' money on iPads, phones a laptop for her 'spoilt' son . A disgraced council worker who used taxpayers' cash to go on a £3,500 spending spree on iPads and mobile phones for her 'spoilt' teenage son has been spared jail. Maria Spruce, 40, was trusted with a local authority credit card but used it to buy the top-of-the-range products and a laptop computer. Town hall bosses at Wolverhampton City Council became suspicious while Spruce, an electoral registration assistant, was on a three-week holiday to Australia last November. They discovered that she had made 47 unauthorised purchases on the card, totalling £3,517, over a six-month period last year. Spruce admitted once count of fraud by position but was spared jail when she appeared at Wolverhampton Crown Court on Friday. She was handed a six-month prison sentence, suspended for two years. Judge John Warner said: 'You had been trusted with the credit card but used it in a dishonest way. 'I accept that you were under pressure at home in relation to your son but many people have those sorts of pressures but get on with their life without resorting to dishonesty.' The court heard that Spruce, of Bilston, in the West Midlands, bought the items for her son who was 'very controlling and aggressive'. Prosecutor Joanne Barker said: 'A colleague covering the duties of the defendant opened a credit card statement and saw it had been used for purchases that were not legitimate office business. 'She told her employer that she had bought the items for her son who was very controlling and could be aggressive towards her.' Wendy Miller, defending, said: 'This was not a sophisticated fraud and was always going to be detected. 'She was trying to satisfy her only son who is difficult to control.

A former neighbour of Spruce said: 'She bent over backwards for her son. He was very spoilt but she never gave him the discipline he needed. 'She probably felt guilty about being a single mum but she allowed herself to be completely manipulated by him.' Speaking after the sentencing, Wolverhampton councillor Paul Sweet said the sentence sent out a 'strong message'. 'The city council operates a zero tolerance policy on fraud and corruption and takes all allegations of fraudulent activity made to us extremely seriously,' he said.

{"question": "(CNN)It was nothing if not predictable. Take combustible issues like religion and sexuality, stir in a new law and talk of a boycott, then -- boom! -- the debate on social media explodes. And so it has proved with Indiana's new \"religious freedom\" law, signed Thursday by Gov. Mike Pence. The new law could allow businesses to turn away gay and lesbian customers if serving them would contravene the business owner's religious beliefs. Supporters of the bill say it protects their right to believe as they choose. Opponents say it is nothing but bigotry dressed up as liberty. The debate is nothing if not vitriolic. And colorful, too. \"Libs SHUTUP,\" reads one tweet, which goes on to assert that Indiana's \"Relgious Freedom Restauration Act (sic)\" is modeled on federal legislation signed by President Bill Clinton in 1993. People on the other side of the debate are equally emphatic -- and, it seems for the moment, more numerous. Some have likened the new law to permitting businesses to discriminate against black people, if perchance their religion dictated that. Others say that Indiana seems out of step with modern times. And then there is the business reaction -- both the nascent boycott from outside the state and the rush by some businesses inside the state to declare that, law or no law, they have no intention of turning anyone away. \"My team just canceled travel to IN due to the #ReligiousFreedomRestorationAct,\" tweeted a user under the name Mark C Somerville, who says he works for @salesforce. \"We stand against discrimination.\" And a tweet from a the St. Elmo Steak House, a business in Indianapolis, the state's capital and its largest city, pledged in capital letters to continue serving ALL.

Brett Bingham, who teaches special education, has filed multiple complaints against the Multnomah Education Service District for allegedly harassing and discriminating against the educator because of his sexual orientation. Bingham found out he was being placed on leave during a field trip with his students on Friday. Oregon's 2014 Teacher of the Year Brett Bingham claims he has been placed on paid adminsitrative leave because he used his title as a platform to speak publicly about being gay . He said it was his lawyer, who received a letter from the district, who broke the news. 'I returned to school and nobody spoke to me,' he told Fox 12. 'At 3.30 I just packed up my favorite plants and put a box of my stuff together that I was afraid would be thrown away and I left.' According to a complaint Bingham filed with the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries Civil Rights Division, problems with the district began shortly after he was named the state's  teacher of the year in October 2013. Bingham claims one such incident occurred after he was asked about his sexual orientation while giving a speech. The teacher said his department head left the event immediately and without saying anything to Bingham. He then claims she told him he could not speak about being gay or 'someone is going to shoot you in the head'. Bingham then alleged that the district placed him under a 'gag order' in April and told him he could not publicly speak or write unless his comments were approved. The teacher said he then filed a grievance with his union, which stated that he felt he was receiving 'disparate treatment' because of his sexual orientation. Bingham (pictured here with his partner on their wedding day) claims one department head told him he could not speak about being gay or 'someone is going to shoot you in the head' Bingham claims the following retaliation was swift. He said he was told that he now had to receive district approval before he could attend any teacher of the year events and was denied from appearing at two Gay Straight Student Alliance events, as well as working with a local LGBTQ community center. Bingham said management also began ordering him to pick up coffee and take out their garbage, 'menial tasks' he claims he was not asked to perform 'prior to the greater public awareness of my sexual orientation'. Relations between Bingham and the district worsened when school officials said the teacher would lose his job if he attended a gala for the National Education Association's Foundation, who were presenting him with an award, in Washington, D.C., he claims. District Superintendent Barbara Jorgensen allegedly told Bingham he would not be granted leave to attend any events related to teacher of the year, claiming he had too many school absences. Bingham, who teaches special education, has filed multiple complaints against the Multnomah Education Service District for allegedly discriminating against the educator because of his sexual orientation . Relations between Bingham and the district worsened after the teacher was told he would lose his job if he attended the National Education Association gala, where he was to be presented with an award . In a tweet Bingham claimed district officials told him they would consider letting him 'attend the NEA awards' if he recalled his state and federal complaints. Bingham was eventually allowed to attend the event after the Oregon Education Association found a clause in his contract that protected his job, according to OregonLive. Jorgensen was removed from the Superintendent position last week but the district claimed Bingham's complaints were not a factor, according to Fox 12. But Bingham believes nothing has changed and that there are other officials in the district who want to see him fired. 'There's no other explanation because I've never been in trouble,' he said. 'I have an excellent reputation.' MESD spokeswoman Laura Conroy declined to elaborate the district's reason for putting Bingham on paid administrative leave.", "answer": ["Brett Bingham has filed multiple complaints against the Multnomah Education Service District in Oregon for alleged discrimination .\nClaimed one department head told him he could not speak about being gay because 'someone is going to shoot' him 'in the head'\nSaid department would not allow him to appear at Gay Straight Student Alliance events or work at the local LGBTQ community center .\nAlleged that management also began ordering him to get coffee or take out trash after he started publicly speaking about his sexual orientation .\nThe district has not specified why Bingham was placed on leave ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "Celebrity chef Pete Evans was in the classroom on Thursday, teaching students about the benefits of his controversial 'Paleo Way' diet, just a day after his children's cookbook was delayed amid fears the recipes could stunt the growth of babies. His school visit comes as it was claimed negative comments about his diet are being deleted from his official Facebook page, meaning only positive and supportive feedback is published. Despite the Public Health Association of Australia expressing concerns that 'Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way' cookbook could cause the death of infants, Evans visited a school in Ballarat, Victoria, where he taught children in years five and six how to cook paleo recipes. Scroll down for video . Celebrity chef Pete Evans was in the classroom on Thursday, teaching students about the benefits of his controversial 'Paleo Way' diet . 'We had the best time this morning with the grade 5 and 6 kids cooking thai chicken cakes with cucumber, avo, lettuce and corriander,' 'Paleo Pete' posted on his Facebook page. 'We also cooked mighty meaty muffins with loadsa vegies and some chia seed and coconut puddings. Nothing I love more than seeing kids learning new skills!' On Wednesday, it was announced that the release of Evan's paleo cookbook for children had been delayed due to grave concerns about the nutritional value of recipes in the book. The cookbook, Bubba Yum Yum: the Paleo Way, is the joint venture of celebrity chef and My Kitchen Rules judge Evans, a long time advocate for the paleo diet, baby-blogger Charlotte Carr and naturopath Helen Padarin. The Public Health Association of Australia said that one of the recipes- a do-it-yourself baby formula made from liver and bone broth- had the potential to stunt the growth of babies and impair development. 'In my view, there's a very real possibility that a baby may die if this book goes ahead,' said Professor Heather Yeatman, president of the PHAA. The criticism comes amid claims comments on Evans' Facebook page expressing negative sentiments over the paleo lifestyle are being deleted. Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way, has been slammed by the Public Health Association of Australia as having the potential to stunt the growth of babies . Evans visited a school in Ballarat, Victoria, where he taught children in years five and six how to cook paleo recipes . Daria, a health professional, posted on 'Blocked by Evans' after she had comments deleted and was blocked from his official Facebook page . After accusations from readers that their feedback was being erased, a rival Facebook page called Blocked By Evans was started, where people could raise their concerns freely. There was also a Twitter hashtag #blockedbypete. Just this week, in the wake of the cookbook controversy, comments questioning the safety of the broth were removed and the posters blocked from the page. Kirstie Cubbins, 31, a stay-at-home mother, had several comments she posted about the health concerns authorities has raised removed from the page. 'I linked to a News article about it [the bone and liver broth] and pointed out what the particular concerns about the formula was, and that it was by the public health authority,' Ms Cubbins told Daily Mail Australia. 'My comments were met with being told I was not welcome on the page as I was not going to support the paleo lifestyle.' Ms Cubbins comments were deleted and she was blocked from responding, though replies to her comments were left on the page. 'I haven't even commented on Pete Evans' page before but had been aware he is prone to deleting comments and blocking people,' she said. An ironic Twitter account mocked Evans visit to the school despite the controversy surrounding the book . 'My comments were never abusive, derogatory, rude or full of swearing. They just put the factual information across about why the baby formula recipe and other recipes in the new book were dangerous to babies.' Daria, a Paediatric Occupational Therapist, had a similar experience on the page when Evans posted to his Facebook page comments linking the modern Australian diet and the rise of autism. Evans, who is currently on a national tour promoting the paleo lifestyle, has long been a passionate advocate of the diet . 'I was disappointed to see yet another celebrity making an incorrect judgement about the developmental disorder. I commented to say that his statement was incorrect and that ASD [autism spectrum disorder] has multiple causes of which we are still discovering many,' Daria told Daily Mail Australia. Daria said she was surprised to see that Evans was advocating the elimination of entire food groups, including grains, and posted a further question regarding how the celebrity chef came to the conclusion 'despite good scientific evidence to show their nutritional benefit, particularly in wholegrain form.' Both of her comments were deleted and she is now blocked from commenting or liking any post on the page. 'I think banning and blocking people who are questioning, asking questions and discussing comments that are genuine and polite is dangerous because it creates an environment where one person controls what information is visible,' Daria said. 'Pete Evans has blocked many health professionals and professional bodies from his page. These are people who unlike him have extensive training, clinical experience and access to scientific evidence about health,' she said. 'I would think their skills would be respected by someone who wants to improve societies health. Its important to promote trust and dialogue between medical and health professionals and the public.' Publisher Pan Macmillan has reportedly held off on the scheduled release date of the cookbook of March 13 . Charlotte Carr (left), the wife of Australian Idol contestant Wes Carr (centre), runs the popular Bubba Yum Yum website and is a co-author of the book . Following claims in December last year that comments were being deleted from the page, three social media users launched a response page 'Blocked by Pete Evans' to address what they saw as a dangerous trend of blocking genuine discussion. Gabrielle, one of the moderators of the page, said that many people had been blocked from Pete Evan's official page, most of whom were enquiring for more information about the specifics of the diet. 'I and most of the individuals on this page where blocked for simply asking a question that challenged paleo ideology or posting a scientific journal paper link that disproved claims being made,' Gabrielle told Daily Mail Australia. 'We have been accused of being \"trolls\". However simply asking a question in a civil manner is not trolling. I have only ever commented on his page once and I was blocked,' she said. Gabrielle said that several health professionals even had their accounts 'pre-blocked'. 'A couple of dietitians who have their own blogs wrote open letters asking Pete to stop tarnishing our profession and for this they were pre blocked without even writing on his wall,' she said. 'It is very sad when someone who claims to know all the answers cannot even answer to health professionals.' Gabrielle said that she had even seen instances of 'tribe followers' asking for advice on ailments and being berated by users, or having their comments deleted. 'In the instance where a health professional has suggested they visit a doctor it is also deleted, which as you can imagine is a a great concern for the health of the individual reaching out.' Pete Evans, pictured with fellow paleo enthusiasts Luke Hines (left), and Wes Carr, wife of fellow co-author Charlotte Carr, has been an outspoken advocate of the paleo diet . Evans has previously released two best-selling cookbooks through publisher Pan MacMillan, including titles Family Food and Healthy Every Day . Evans, a My Kitchen Rules judge, is  a long time advocate for the paleo diet and has been outspoken . The publisher of the paleo baby cookbook, Pan Macmillan Australia, released a statement which advised that 'the publication of Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way has been delayed, and not recalled as incorrectly stated by Australian Women's Weekly on March 11, 2015. The publisher will be making no further comment at this time.' Evans has previously released two best-selling cookbooks through publisher Pan MacMillan, including titles Family Food and Healthy Every Day, and Carr, the wife of Australian Idol contestant Wes Carr, runs the popular Bubba Yum Yum website. Federal Health Minister Sussan Ley has allegedly been contacted regarding the issue, and publisher Pan Macmillan has reportedly held off on the scheduled release date of the cookbook of March 13. The Federal Department of Health released a statement regarding the concerns that had been brought to its attention. 'The Department of Health is aware of this publication and has concerns about the inadequate nutritional value of some of the recipes, in particular the infant formula, and has been consulting with experts and will continue to investigate this matter,' the statement said. A disclaimer at the back of the cookbook states that the co-authors 'in good faith' the recipes will lead to a healthier life, 'relying on the information contained in this publication may not give you the results you desire or may cause negative health consequences.' Despite this, the book has been described as 'a treasure trove of nutritional information and nourishing paleo recipes that are guaranteed to put you and your little one on the path to optimum health.'", "answer": ["Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way was set for release on Friday March 13 .\nIt is a cookbook co-authored by celebrity chef Pete Evans along with baby-blogger Charlotte Carr and naturopath Helen Padarin .\nThe book has been slammed by the Public Health Association of Australia who claim that children could potentially die from the recipes .\nOne of the recipes is a DIY baby formula made from liver and bone broth .\nComments questioning the paleo diet have been deleted from Evan's official Facebook page meaning only positive comments are allowed .\nUsers say they were blocked from commenting after expressing concerns about the broth and posting links to scientific articles with information .\nEvans continued his Paleo Way tour on Thursday, visiting primary schools .\nPublisher Pan MacMillan has postponed its release amid the concerns ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "Saudi Arabia is beheading criminals at an unprecedented rate - almost half of them for non-violent drugs crimes, the human rights charity Amnesty International has warned. The Arab state is believed to have executed 38 people so far this year, treble the number in the same period in 2014 and a sign its new King Salman is showing no mercy to offenders. Now Amnesty has sounded the latest of several warnings over the country's 'unfair' justice system and harsh punishments. Regime: Some 38 people have already been beheaded in Saudi Arabia this year. King Salman (above meeting British Prime Minister David Cameron) was crowned in January and shows no sign of leniency . The charity's Saudi Arabia researcher, Sevag Kechichian, told Adam Withnall of The Independent: 'Almost half of this year's executions have actually been for non-violent drugs-related offences. 'There's no real rhyme or reason for this upsurge in executions, and in a way this makes it all the more alarming.' The Saudi authorities insist there is a surge in the number of executions because . Rape, murder, apostasy, armed robbery and drug trafficking are all punishable by death under Saudi Arabia's version of Islamic sharia law. No mercy: King Salman pictured in January . One diplomatic source told the AFP news agency the surge in beheadings had started long before the reign of King Salman, who was crowned in January after the death of his half-brother King Abdullah. 'The Saudi authorities want to show everyone they are strong, people can rely on them to keep the security and the safety in the kingdom,' said the source. The insider claimed the aim was to deter all forms of violence but the policy is linked to the kingdom's fight against the Islamic State group. In September, Saudi Arabia began air strikes against the terrorists in Syria as part of the US-led coalition, raising concerns about possible retaliation inside the kingdom. Security officers arrested three Saudis who allegedly acted 'in support of' the group when they shot and wounded a Dane in November. But Mr Kechichian said: 'The current rate has been truly unprecedented. It would... be a stretch to say that this is an attempt to deter violence.' The United Nations has said many Saudi trials are 'by all accounts grossly unfair' and that confessions are obtained under torture. Amnesty's annual report last week made a similar warning. 'Courts continued to impose death sentences for a range of crimes, including some that did not involve violence, such as \"sorcery\", adultery and drug offences, frequently after unfair trials,' it said. Trickle of news: Individual beheadings are only discovered when confirmed by the Interior Ministry (above) 'Some defendants, including foreign nationals facing murder charges, alleged that they had been tortured or otherwise coerced or misled into making false confessions in pre-trial detention.' Those executed have included five Pakistanis, an Indian, two Jordanians, two Syrians and a Yemeni, with few foreign governments willing to appeal publicly for clemency from the oil-rich state. Three beheadings in a single day on Tuesday - one for rape and two for murder - took the total so far this year to 38, according to an AFP tally.", "answer": ["Amnesty International says Arab state has beheaded 38 people this year .\nThat is treble the number executed over the same period in 2014 .\nCharity says nearly half have been for non-violent drugs crimes .\nTally seen as sign new King Salman will show no mercy to offenders ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "(CNN)Milan has Moxy, while much of Europe is painted Blu. Jaz in the City is playing in Amsterdam come September. EVEN increases the odds of a good night's sleep, while Tune is in harmony with scaled-down budgets. And then there's the vibrant Vib and a new venue, Venu, soon arriving in Dubai. These statements begin to make sense once you realize that they're all the names of modern hotel brands. According to Chekitan S. Dev, a professor at the Cornell University School of Hotel Administration, hotels traditionally have been named after an owner or a place. But more recently, he says, \"the naming process has evolved from an off-the-cuff process into something far more systematic.\" So what's behind this influx of idiosyncratic hotel names, replete with misspellings and unexpected word usages? Look to millennials and psychographics -- the study of personality, attitudes, interests and lifestyles. Psychologists say the millennial psychographic is made up of independent-minded, adventurous individuals in search of new experiences. Hospitality brands are crafting their marketing strategies accordingly. \"Hotel companies are lazering in on consumer needs by using psychographic data in a big way,\" says Matthew Von Ertfelda, Marriott's vice president for insight, strategy and innovation. The explosion of social media also has a starring role in the name game. Brands of the 21st century need to have handles that resonate in the global, online world, say the pros. \"Thanks to social media, millennials are the first global generation,\" says Dr. Donna Quadri-Felitti, academic chair of New York University's School of Professional Studies Tisch Center for Hospitality and Tourism. \"And since this generation is so enamored with texting and tweeting, hotels really have to think how names will play in the new media world.\" For social media purposes, the number of characters in a name counts. Spelling is often sacrificed in the quest for brevity. But another reason for purposeful misspellings may be legal. Spelling is often set into an uncommon form to retain meaning while being trademarkable. \"The odder the name, the less likely someone has already captured it,\" says Cornell professor Dev. \"That's important in terms of intellectual property protection.\" It may explain why Venu and Vib are missing an \"e.\" Venu is a just-announced lifestyle brand, launching its first property in Dubai in 2017. According to parent company Jumeirah Hotels & Resorts, it's designed to give travelers \"the freedom to write their own story, their own narrative, to build their own scene.\" Best Western's new hotel entry, called Vib, is pronounced \"vibe.\" \"We tried to come up with names that celebrated individuality, while also connoting a vibrant spirit,\" says Dick Lew, a partner at Houston-based Acumen Design, a branding firm brought in to hone the name and the image. Hence Vib, which is derived from \"vibrant.\" Color also plays a big part in hotel branding. \"We incorporated a bright persimmon red in the design and the logo, in order to reflect the (Vib) brand's bold personality,\" says Lew. Moxy, the new Marriott partnership with IKEA, is going after \"a sassy, determined, individualistic consumer,\" according to Marriott's Von Ertfelda. The first Moxy opened at Milan's Malpensa Airport in September and more are coming in Europe this year. \"Naming Moxy was a four-month process involving a great deal of brainstorming,\" says Von Ertfelda. \"Once we came up with it, we knew we had a name with emotional resonance that hit a global sweet spot. \"At the same time, though, our lawyers noted the name had to be 'ownable and trademarkable.'\" The change of spelling from moxie to Moxy achieved that. According to Von Ertfelda, senior creative director Maria Rezende-Heiston selected hot pink for the Moxy logo to \"appeal to those who aren't afraid to express themselves\" while using a \"curved font to convey a sense of rhythm, fluidity and independence.\" Color is also key to hotel operator Carlson Rezidor, which is hueing (sic) toward Red and Blu. Blu came about in 2009, after airline SAS withdrew from a partnership with Radisson. After the split, Radisson SAS, a collection of European design hotels, needed a new name. \"We wanted to replace SAS with an equally short name,\" says Rose Anderson, vice president of branding for the Carlson Rezidor Hotel Group. \"We liked using blue from the old SAS logo, because it brought in the heritage of the former brand. \"At the same time, we were looking for a word with positive worldwide connotations ... and blue is the world's favorite color.\" So blue or bleu became Blu, a trademarkable spelling. Carlson Rezidor recently announced a new Red brand that will, according to Anderson, \"build on the Blu concept and further leverage Radisson's brand awareness.\" New brands are also being dubbed with what may seem to be random nouns. But there's nothing random about them. Last year, InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) rolled out EVEN, a new brand cultivated for the growing wellness-minded audience, with two properties in the United States. EVEN expresses the desire for the balance travelers are seeking, says an IHG spokesperson. In its logo, specific colors were chosen to represent elements of nature. The four vertical bars of the logo are off-kilter, while the EVEN letters are composed on a flat horizontal line, representing the brand promise of helping guests stay in balance. Malaysia-based Tune Hotels provides \"five-star beds at a one-star price.\" The group has more than 40 properties worldwide, including five in London. Some in its management group were previously senior executives in the music business. It makes sense, then, that a travel company with a musical name would attempt to strike a global chord. Adding to the medley of avant garde brands, Germany's Steigenberger Hotel Group's Amsterdam hotel Jaz in the City will open in September, with others scheduled to follow. According to Steigenberger Hotel Group, coming Jaz in the City properties will be \"hip and happening hotels\" that \"move to the rhythm of today's curious global traveler\" who has a \"desire to embrace authentic experiences in a city hotel.\" You can't explore the hospitality industry's desire to appeal to the millennial mindset without nodding to W Hotels by Starwood. The brand now seems to have been ahead of its time with hotels that opened in pre-social media 1998. \"Starwood was the first hotel company to look directly at the customer as it evolved a new brand,\" says Paul James, global brand leader of W Hotels Worldwide, St. Regis and The Luxury Collection. W's target customer was a fashionable, high-energy individual -- someone who'd now likely be described as having a millennial psychographic. Starwood defined the brand by adding its \"Whatever, Whenever\" tagline to the simple W logo. Cornell's Dev says Starwood further imbued the brand with meaning by using words like witty, warm and welcoming in its advertising and marketing material. More than 15 years later, the W Hotel brand has more than 70 properties open or in development worldwide. Journalist Laura Powell started covering the travel industry for CNN in the 1980s.

{"question": "England's Ross Fisher faces a completely different challenge as he looks to successfully defend a European Tour title for the first time in his career in this week's Tshwane Open. Fisher ended a four-year victory drought with his win 12 months ago at The Els Club at Copperleaf, which, at 7,964 yards, was the longest course in European Tour history. This year the tournament, which is the sixth and final event co-sanctioned with the Sunshine Tour this season, has been switched to Pretoria Country Club, which measures 7,063 yards and has had the par-five fourth and 18th holes reduced to par fours, making it a par 70. Ross Fisher says it will be tough for him at the Tshwane Open this year but that he is looking forward to it . The Englishman plays a shot during a practice round at the Pretoria Country Club . Fisher poses with the trophy last year . 'It's a lot shorter and a lot more fiddly,' said Fisher of the course, which was redesigned in 2004 by Gary Player, who calls it a 'hidden gem'. 'There will be a lot of positional play off the tee, a lot of irons and not many drivers. 'It's an adaptation that we have to make as players. We don't generally play these types of golf courses. 'It's very different and I would prefer to be on a long golf course that's quite tight, because driving is my strength. 'It's going to be different this week. Your wedges will have to be sharp and you're going to have to get a hot putter, because I can imagine the scoring will be pretty good with some quality players here this week. 'I'm looking forward to the challenge and hopefully the game can live up to that.' Compatriot Andy Sullivan missed the cut in the Africa Open last week but is looking for his third win in South Africa in the space of 10 weeks, while home favourite George Coetzee has the benefit of local knowledge. Pretoria native Coetzee has been a member of the club since he took up the sport and won his first tournament here at the age of 10. 'I didn't build my game at this golf course,' Coetzee said. 'I putted well to shoot good scores here, but it's a drawer's golf course. There is a lot of risk and reward and on a lot of holes you can take it on. 'There are some advantages to knowing the course as well as I do, but it suits a certain type of golfer. Hopefully I make enough putts to make up for that.

{"question": "Hidden in a vault in Marrakesh, it has been one of the most highly-anticipated albums in music history. And tonight, after six years, the Wu-Tang Clan finally opened the handcrafted silver box that holds their unheard record Once Upon A Time In Shaolin - before sealing it away once more. In an attempt to break free from the Spotify and YouTube era of freely-shared music, rap's most influential collective is selling the 31-track double LP to one bidder for millions of dollars. After a private online-only sale this month through art dealers Paddle8 - which employs Britain's Princess Eugenie - the buyer cannot share the album for at least 88 years. DailyMail.com was there with the group's de facto leader RZA, producer Cilvaringz, a small group of prospective buyers and half a dozen selected fans in Queens, New York City, for the first and last time any of the album would be played before the year 2103. Scroll down for video . Unprecendented: This is the Wu-Tang Clan's record Once Upon A Time In Shaolin that was played on Monday night to a small group before it is sold and kept secret until the year 2103. It has been six years in the making . The record comes in a silver, jeweled box with a specially-designed wax seal and a leather-bound book . The box: It was displayed for potential buyers who are expected to pay millions to obtain the sole incarnation . The Staten Island-born group revived the East Coast as an epicenter for hip hop in the early 1990s . Confirming the rumors that she would make a guest appearance, Cher's voice bellowed out during the 13-minute extract. And though it wasn't played, DailyMail.com understands it to be true that Barcelona FC players also make a cameo appearance. Typical of the group's first record 36 Chambers, it features styles that shook the music scene in 1994 - soul samples, clips of dialogue from movies, and fierce rapping over sound effects of rain and thunder. Reiterating its own grandeur, there are regular skits and pieces of dialogue that say, 'this has never been done before.' All of the Staten Island clan's eight living members appear on it - but had no idea what they were recording when they laid down their parts. The record casing was handcrafted from silver and wood by artists in Morocco, with a seal designed and printed by wax-smiths in Serbia. 'This has never been done before,' RZA told DailyMail.com after playing the record. 'Music is just handed out now, the industry is in crisis. People feel like they deserve to have it for free. This is art. You can take a picture of the Mona Lisa but that's not art. 'The same with this: you can never reproduce it - this is the final thing.' The pre-sale event played up to the idea. Those invited were subjected to airport-style security checks, and electronic devices were confiscated. In a dark room, buyers spoke to auctioneers as light symphony music played. The nickel silver and jeweled case with black cow leather lining was sat on a podium under spotlight, with two bodyguards standing either side. While some  were fans, others were advisers who hailed from as far as Asia to inspect the 'artwork'. One adviser for a Chinese collector, who wished to remain anonymous, told DailyMail.com collectors are clamouring to get their hands on the record and its silver box - whether they like Wu-Tang or not. The box comes inside a cedar wood treasure chest covered with black cow leather and light beige velvet lining. Inside, is a cinematic-style record, plus a leather-bound 174-page manuscript printed on gilded Fedrigoni Marina parchment with lyrics, credits, tales about the recording. The adviser said: 'Someone said it would be worth $1 million. That's nothing. This is something completely different; completely new. I don't think I could put a price on it. 'The concept has not been seen before - and from the biggest rap collective in history... It is huge.' The Wu-Tang Clan formed in the early 1990s, reviving the East Coast's reputation as an epicenter for hip hop. RZA - pronounced 'rizza' - drew together nine MCs, including his own cousins who adopted the pseudonyms Ol' Dirty Bastard and GZA. The remaining slots were filled by Raekwon, Masta Killa, U-God, Ghostface Killah, Method Man, and Inspectah Deck. Ambition: RZA, né Robert Fitzgerald Diggs, wants the long-awaited album to be treated like a work of art . Unlike their other albums, it has not been produced by the group's de facto leader RZA (pictured) but by his apprentice, Moroccan rapper and producer Tarik 'Cilvaringz' Azzougar . The new album pays homage to the Wu-Tang Clan's history and meteoric rise to dominate the record industry . With industry domination in their sights, RZA saw that each member of the Clan was signed with different production companies, while maintaining their loyalty as a group. Their first album, 36 Chambers, was hailed as unprecedented, with samples from soul music and kung fu movies. Spanning 128 minutes, the stories and rhymes were largely recorded in Staten Island, New York, and hark back to their original mid-90s lyrics about the Shaolin. It features all eight of the original members plus some affiliate rappers. And as for Cher's cameo appearance, RZA said: 'Did nobody ever have a crush on Cher? She's the ultimate. Ain't nobody like Cher.' Unlike their other albums, it has not been produced by the group's de facto leader RZA but by his apprentice, Moroccan rapper and producer Tarik 'Cilvaringz' Azzougarh - a Wu-Tang fan who visited the group's New York office five times until they took him on. Cilvaringz explains he and RZA were already developing the concept of a record charting the Wu's history when the music industry changed completely. Once Upon A Time In Shaolin has been stored in a handmade silver and nickel box embossed with the Wu's Shaolin symbol and a decorative design by Yahya, a British-Moroccan artist . Collectively, the group has produced seven albums - sometimes within months of each other . Within five years singles plummeted to the price of $0.99, and artists were streaming their work for free. Simultaneously, Cilvaringz was chairing an art festival in Morocco, where he saw three tent poles bought for thousands of dollars. 'That [was] the first time I asked myself: \"Why and how are these artists valued at such a price?\" People like Dre or Kanye or RZA are geniuses in what they do, and their music is valued at 99 cents. 'No disrespect to Andy Warhol, Basquiat, Damien Hirst, or any other artists, but if you walk down the streets and ask people randomly, \"Do you know Damien Hirst? Do you know Basquiat?\" they'll say \"Who?\" If you say, \"Do you know Dr. Dre? Do you know Kanye?,\" they'll say \"Yeah.\"' The album, he says, pays homage to the Wu-Tang Clan's history and meteoric rise to dominate the record industry. The group became known for their business genius as they created a collective but each had their own solo contracts, thereby dominating the recording industry . 36 Chambers: This was the collective's debut album which revolutionized the hip hop scene . And despite years of disputes erupting between the clan's members, RZA insists that there was 'no tension' when he informed his brethren he had been working on a secret album, adding 'the eight members, excluding myself, are the most talented MCs I have ever encountered. They are true artists because they aren't taught. You can't teach art.'

{"question": "(CNN)With the ongoing protests over the shooting death by police of black teenager Tony Robinson in Madison, Wisconsin, the racist chanting of fraternity members at the University of Oklahoma, and now the inexcusable shootings of two police officers in Ferguson, Missouri, it's safe to say that the always-strained race relations in this country are being pushed to the breaking point. And the point with the most stress is the delicate relationship between police forces and the minority communities that they serve. To approach things from a more positive angle, the situation is dire enough that we absolutely have to try to uncover the good and not dwell on the negative. The best time to make things better is when it seems that everything is getting worse. This unacceptable status quo can motivate us to take the necessary steps to address the problems, which are not going to disappear unless we honestly deal with them. When things are going wrong, responsible people can begin by saying the right things. President Obama said on Twitter, \"Violence against police is unacceptable. Our prayers are with the officers in MO. Path to justice is one all of us must travel together.\" The Congressional Black Caucus issued a statement saying, \"The CBC understands the frustrations in Ferguson, but a response of violence is not the answer during this transformative moment in our country.\" And Attorney General Eric Holder noted, \"This was not someone trying to bring healing to Ferguson. ... This was a damn punk, a punk who was trying to sow discord.\" For the most part, authorities in Missouri have been careful not to blame the peaceful protesters. Surely, not all responses have been as measured, but the gravity of the situation will hopefully bring out the best in people. While we pause for a moment to let passions cool, we can use the time to consider how best to move forward with common resolve instead of mutual recrimination. The way forward is to engage citizens in the community -- to bring them into the room when decisions are being made about policing policies and procedures to make sure that those policies and procedures address the community's real concerns. And it's about putting law enforcement officers in the community as welcome members of that community -- as guarantors of the safety and security of the people instead of intimidating outside forces. This approach would benefit both the community and the police. I'm certain that officers would rather be appreciated and valued by the people they serve than be pressured to fill city coffers by issuing unnecessary citations, as noted in the DOJ report on Ferguson. Nobody becomes a cop because they secretly long to be a collection agent. One of the easiest ways to integrate law enforcement officers into the community is to physically put them on the sidewalks by increasing the number of cops who work good old-fashioned foot beats. Officers who view the world through a patrol car window are separated from the people they serve by more than a sheet of glass. Being encased in a vehicle alienates a person from the world around them. The cop on the beat is not just a quaint notion from old movies, he can be a bridge between police forces and the people they serve. Another idea is to give cops bicycles, which has brought so many law enforcement officials in touch with other cyclists in the community. Lack of community policing is one of the shortcomings cited in the DOJ report on Ferguson. In areas where the gulf between law enforcement and the neighborhood is too wide, mediators can be used to initially bring the two sides together. After all, both sides ultimately have the same goal of safe and peaceful neighborhoods. Both police departments and members of the community can take proactive steps to come together on more than a purely professional level.  A tech services company in the South Bronx recently hosted a video game competition with police officers and residents of the neighborhood. The event left local teenagers saying things about the cops like \"basically they're like us.\" Ultimately, police should be considered members of the community -- a notion that needs to be encouraged by police departments and neighborhoods alike. Communities can make the local cops part of their neighborhood celebrations. New Orleans Police Det. Winston Harbin became a minor Internet celebrity for his impromptu dancing with local people during Mardi Gras. Besides just being fun, Harbin's interaction with the community helped foster the type of mutual appreciation and respect that are essential to effective community policing. Fear and mistrust among minority communities toward police are the legacy of many decades of racism, unequal treatment, bias, subjective stereotyping and lack of opportunity. It is times like now, when that anger and resentment are boiling, that we address it. With the right approach, we can begin to change the attitude between the black community and the police from \"HandsUpDon'tShoot\" to \"HandsTogetherInTrust.\"", "answer": ["Latest Ferguson shootings push strained race relations to breaking point .\nDonna Brazile: Relationship between police forces and minority communities must improve ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "Our ability to answer questions currently separates us from machines in the world of artificial intelligence. But researchers are working on algorithms to give computers this skill too. Now, scientists at Facebook have come up with questions that they say artificially intelligent machines must answer, if they can ever match human brainpower – but some of them are a bit tricky, meaning some people may fail them too. Scientists at Facebook (logo shown) have come up with questions that they say artificially intelligent machines must answer if they can ever match human brainpower – but some of them are a bit tricky, meaning some people may fail them too . The team from the social media firm’s AI lab in New York have come up with a list of 20 questions to separate humans from robots, because they say ‘many existing learning systems can currently not solve them.’ They test different types of reasoning and the ability to process language. 1) The first question of the 20 listed in the research paper was the simplest for a computer to answer. It is: . John is in the playground . Bob is in the office . Where is John? 2) A harder example for a computer to answer is a question that requires it to differentiate three separate arguments, such as: . Mary gave the cake to Fred. Fred gave the cake to Bill. Jeff was given the milk by Fred. Who gave the cake to Fred? Who did Fred give the cake to? What did Jeff receive? Who gave the milk? 3) Another task tested a machine's ability to perform simple counting operations by asking about the number of objects. For example: . Daniel picked up the football. Daniel dropped the football. Daniel got the milk. Daniel took the apple. How many objects is Daniel holding? 4) Basic deduction skills were tested by questions such as: . Sheep are afraid of wolves. Cats are afraid of dogs. Mice are afraid of cats. Gertrude is a sheep. What is Gertrude afraid of? 5) And reasoning about size was tested by this question: . The football fits in the suitcase. The suitcase fits in the cupboard. The box of chocolates is smaller than the football. Will the box of chocolates sit in the suitcase? The intelligent computers were tested on 20 questions in total, but none of them got a perfect score. The answers to the five examples listed, are shown above . The sometimes tricky questions test different types of reasoning and the ability to process language. A stock image of a perplexed person is shown . Some of the questions require machines to recall facts, while others need reasoning, or to count the number of objects, expressed in a written passage. The researchers say that humans should be able to score full marks. While you may have got one answer wrong, none of the seven computer learning programmes that Facebook tested got all 20 questions right. The experiment was designed to test whether a machine can answer questions ‘via chaining facts, simple induction, deduction and many more,’ the study published on arXiv says. Scientists are keen to create this ability so that humans can talk fluently with machines, which could lead to robots looking after the elderly and more intelligent websites, for example. The paper says: ‘One long-term goal of machine learning research is to produce methods that are applicable to reasoning and natural language, in particular building an intelligent dialogue agent.’ The experts aim to ‘classify these tasks into skill sets, so that researchers can identify (and then rectify) the failings of their systems.’ The results of the test show that humans are still ahead of the game when it comes to interpreting the world’s subtleties and language. The questions are written in very clear and simple terms so there is still a way to go before computers catch us up.", "answer": ["Test was developed by experts at Facebook to test machines with AI .\nIt's comprised of 20 questions testing reasoning and language skills .\nHumans are expected to get a full score, with careful consideration .\nNone of the AI algorithms managed this showing more research is needed ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "David Gill, the Football Association vice- chairman, says FA Cup replays and the two-legged League Cup semi-finals may have to be sacrificed in the season of the 2022 World Cup. Why wait? If anything, replays are detracting from the excitement of the competition, and the format of what is currently the Capital One Cup is an anomaly. It should not take FIFA’s monstrous destruction of football’s calendar to make the English game see sense. By chance, there were no replays in the FA Cup fifth round this year and they were not missed. The great Cup shocks of this campaign have all happened on the day, inside 90 minutes. David Gill suggested removing cup replays, and he has a point, even if it it has taken Qatar to make it happen . Cambridge United were excellent to earn a replay against Manchester United, but lost the second game . That is when Bradford City beat Chelsea and Sunderland, when Middlesbrough eliminated Manchester City, when Blackburn Rovers beat Swansea City then Stoke City. A few lower division tussles aside, all the games that went to replays went with form. Manchester United defeated Cambridge United, Sunderland won at Fulham, Liverpool came from behind to beat Bolton Wanderers and Southampton won against Ipswich Town. Replays favour the bigger teams anyway. If Cambridge could have taken Manchester United to extra-time, and maybe to penalties, on a crummy pitch at a boisterous Abbey Stadium, who knows what might have happened? Heading to a decider at Old Trafford, their moment had passed. Jonathan Stead's goal against Chelsea was part of a shock that re-affirmed the FA Cup's giant killing tradition . Bradford celebrate their win at Stamford Bridge, and didn't need a replay to upset the Premier League leaders . We cling to tradition, but tradition had teams playing replay after replay until they could be separated. Those encounters had an epic feel. In 1979, Arsenal and Sheffield Wednesday needed five matches — including three that went to extra-time — lasting nine hours before they could be torn apart. The second replay ended 2-2, the third 3-3. Arsenal won the fourth 2-0. That is the true gladiatorial tradition of the FA Cup, but it is unthinkable with modern fixture congestion. So as the shoot-out that completes the first replay is in itself a compromise, why is it needed at all? Middlesbrough also caused an upset, by beating Manchester City, but replays rarely lead to shocks . Smaller clubs might be better rewarded if games were decided on the night by a penalty shoot-out . A game decided on the day, one hit, with extra-time and penalties, would go some way to restoring tension and drama. When the FA has to alter its company accounts because the FA Cup sponsorship deal confidently included by former general secretary Alex Horne has not materialised, it is ridiculous to pretend the current format is a winner. The same with the League Cup. It is decided over one game in every round, then two in the semi-finals, and back to one for the final. What is the point of that? Better to have consistency and let the calendar breathe a little. It should not need FIFA’s selfishness to be a catalyst for reform in the English game. The time to change is now.", "answer": ["Qatar World Cup likely to force changes to domestic calendar .\nBut FA Cup replays have lost their appeal - they should be scrapped .\nUpsets rarely happen in the second game, giant-killing would not suffer .\nTwo-leg League Cup semi-finals are a strain on the fixture list .\nSome traditions should be removed, not just because of FIFA's issues ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "Things got very steamy this morning at the Today show studios when host Hoda Kotb and TV personality Regis Philbin took part in new charity dare The Twizzler Challenge live on air, and shared a passionate - if very one-sided - kiss. Hoda, 50, looked as though she got rather more than she bargained for when Regis, 83, energetically took the lead on the act; requiring them to each take opposite ends of one Twizzler, place them in their mouths and nibble the licorice until their lips met in the middle. When Hoda's quick peck on Regis' lips at the end of the challenge did not seem to satisfy her former NBC co-host, he grabbed her head with both hands and delivered her a passionate smooch, as Hoda froze up in surprise. Scroll down for video . Good cause: Much like the now-infamous ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, the Twizzler test has taken off, and benefits Manhattan-based charity New York Collaborates for Autism . Magic moment: The stunt required Hoda and Regis to each take opposite ends of one Twizzler, place them in their mouths and nibble the licorice until their lips met in the middle . Hoda and Regis were officially dared to take on the Twizzler Challenge last week by Today hosts Matt Lauer and Kathie Lee, who themselves shared a series of rather awkward, perfunctory kisses during their on-screen moment. Once the concept, which aims to raise awareness for autism, was explained to Regis during his guest segment on the show this morning, he enthusiastically asked: 'Are we going to kiss?' 'I'm not sure,' responded Hoda, before timidly spritzing his open mouth with breath spray. 'Let me look at your lips,' Regis exclaimed, leaning in. 'She could swallow me! I've never seen lips like that. Honest to God, something's going to happen.' And indeed it did. Hoda nibbled at the licorice straw until she reached Regis' lips, before issuing him a conservative peck. Too much? Today host Hoda Kotb, 50, (right) got more than she bargained for as part of this morning's Twizzler Challenge, when former co-host Regis Philbin, 83, (left) smothered her with an enthusiastic smacker .

Regis then launched in for a full-on smooch, as Hoda darted her head away, only for Regis to grab her back and give her a lingering mouth-to-mouth smacker. 'Boy you look like you went in there!' squealed Kathie Lee, as Hoda recovered in stunned silence. 'It was pretty good,' attested Regis, lipstick smeared over his face. 'You got a boyfriend?' Much like the now-infamous ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, those who fail to complete the Twizzler test after being nominated have to donate to Manhattan-based charity New York Collaborates for Autism.

Meredith explained that she first took the challenge with Today co-anchor Willie Geist the previous week on her talk show and later donated $5,000 to support autism programs nationwide. Get away! Hoda tried to push Regis away as he lunged in to take the kiss even further . Recovery: Hoda was visibly shaken after the amorous display, which took place live on air . 'This is clearly a transparent attempt by Meredith once gain to make out with her colleague,' Willie joked on the morning show. Meredith immediately made it clear that she intended to challenge Matt, but remained coy about who his partner would be. 'Is there anybody around that we can ask?' Willie said. Savannah Guthrie, who was sitting next to Matt, quickly left her chair. 'I am willing to get up out of this seat,' she said as she made room for Matt's partner. When Kathie Lee walked on stage, Matt enthusiastically told her: 'Get over here.' Panic: Ironically, it was Regis who was most concerned about the challenge before it began, telling Hoda that he was worried she would 'swallow him' because of the size of her lips . Kathie Lee joked to Matt: 'Your world is going to be on fire.' 'This is nothing compared to what goes on in the make-up room,' she added. As Kathie Lee and Matt sat face to face, they both noted that their awkward encounter was all in aid of a good cause. 'And then we get to challenge somebody,' Matt explained. Kathie Lee stared at Matt with her eyes wide open before she started to furiously eat the Twizzler that was in her mouth, quickly moving towards her partner. 'Really aggressive,' Willie commented from the sidelines. Follow the leader: Hoda and Regis were officially challenged to take on The Twizzler Challenge by Today hosts Matt Lauer and Kathie Lee, who themselves took part last week (pictured) Matt pulled away as Kathie Lee's lips brushed his, only to move back into to give her another kiss.

After their epic kiss, Kathie Lee nominated her former co-host Regis Philbin and her current co-star Hoda Kotb for the Twizzler Challenge. After their epic kiss, Kathie nominated Regis and Hoda for the Twizzler Challenge. But Matt had a different pairing in mind, noting that the cast of Mad Men would be on the show on Monday.

'If John Slattery needs an understudy for that Twizzler Challenge with Jon Hamm, I am available,' Savannah reminded Matt again. The Twizzler Challenge started earlier this month at Comedy Central's Night of Too Many Stars benefit for autism, which was hosted by Jon Stewart. When someone on Twitter dared Willie and Orange is the New Black star Uzo Aduba to have a Lady and the Tramp moment with licorice in exchange for a donation, the Twizzler Challenge was born. Access Hollywood co-hosts Billy Bush and Kit Hoover also took up the same candy-based encounter on their show last Friday before nominating Daily Mail Online Editor-at-Large Piers Morgan and his fellow guest Nina Parker to do the same.

It has emerged that Owens was a 'primary suspect' in the 2000 disappearance of Zebb Quinn, 18, who vanished while he was going to look at a car for sale in Asheville with Owens, then 21. Quinn, who has not been seen since the night of January 2 that year, was captured on surveillance video buying sodas with Owens at a convenience store after he got off work at Walmart at 9pm. The pair then drove away separately. But they were apparently heading to the same destination to look at a Mitsubishi Eclipse for sale that Quinn was interested in buying, police told Fox Carolina. Owens later told police that a short while later, Quinn flashed his headlights at him and the two pulled over. Quinn then went off to return a page, before returning in a 'frantic' state, Owens said. Cancelling the pair's plans to see the Mitsubishi, Quinn reportedly told Owens he needed to leave and drove off, bumping into his friend's truck on his way. Since that moment, he has been missing. On January 3, Quinn's mother, Denise Vlahakis, filed a missing person's report. Two weeks later, the alleged victim's car, a 1990 Mazda Protégé, appeared in the parking lot of a nearby restaurant. Bizarrely, a live puppy was inside the vehicle, which was situated at The Little Pigs Barbecue near a hospital where Vlahakis worked. A pair of lips were also drawn on the car's back windshield.

Bizarrely, a live puppy was inside the vehicle, while a pair of lips were drawn on the car's back windshield . It remains unknown who the Labrador-mix puppy - which was around three months old - belonged to. It was later adopted by a police officer, according to The Charley Project cold cases website. In February, police were authorized to take hair, blood and saliva samples from Owens in relation to the disappearance of Quinn, whom his family said would not have gone away of his own accord. Although they never acquired evidence to warrant charges against Owens, Sheriff Van Duncan told The Citizen-Times in Asheville Owens 'was definitely a primary suspect in the Zebb Quinn case'. Vlahakis later said of her son: 'We all feel very certain that he was killed that night', explaining how he had no extra clothes, money or contact lenses solution with him on the night he vanished. Speaking to Fox Carolina, the grief-stricken mother added: 'It is hard because we don't know and it's hard because we can't say goodbye and kind of put everything at rest.'

Scene: Authorities (pictured at the scene) believe the Codds were murdered on Thursday by Owens - three days before he reportedly returned to their home and stole a 'laptop computer, jewelry and a Glock handgun' In 2012, Quinn's disappearance was featured on the Investigation Discovery Channel show,  'Disappeared', which covered various theories relating to the baffling cold case. One theory revolved around a woman whom Quinn was apparently romantically interested in. The woman, Misty, reportedly had an abusive boyfriend who had made threats toward the teenager. However, Misty and her partner were questioned by police at the time and no arrests were made. Authorities have said said they believe more than one person may have been involved in Quinn’s disappearance and presumed murder. In the Codds' supposed murder case, the couple had hired Owens, who owns a construction company, to do some work at their home. They were both set to leave for work on Sunday. Mrs Codd was catering on a movie set, while her husband was heading off to Los Angeles to work as a key grip on a production. It was a very big movie set for Mrs Codd, as she had just announced her company, Tree Hugger Catering, would be providing food on the set of The Big Short. The adaptation will star Hollywood actors Brad Pitt, Ryan Gosling, Christian Bale and Steve Carell. However, authorities believe the Codds were murdered on Thursday by Owens - three days before he reportedly returned to their home and stole a 'laptop computer, jewelry and a Glock handgun'. Family members reported the couple missing on Sunday, according to reports. Police have not disclosed whether they have suspicions on how the couple might have been killed. Big names: The adaptation will star Hollywood actors Brad Pitt, Ryan Gosling, Christian Bale and Steve Carell . Mrs Codd, who grew up in Mississippi,was five months' pregnant with their first child at the time. The Codds' cars and two dogs were found at their home. James Fisher, a member of a local band that played the Codds' wedding last September, said the pair were a 'beautiful couple'. Speaking of Mr Codd, the musician told the Citizen-Times of Mr Codd: 'I know he believed in giving people second chances, and he'd hired people out there who'd been in prison.' It remains unclear what Owens' motive was behind the alleged murder. Buncombe County District Attorney Todd Williams said he has not yet decided if he will ask for the death penalty in the case. Owens, who is being held without bail, appeared in court on Tuesday, where he requested an attorney, ABC News 13 reported. His next hearing is scheduled for April 7.", "answer": ["Cristie Schoen Codd, 38 and Joseph Codd were reported missing Sunday .\nPolice believe they were killed in Leicester, North Carolina, on Thursday .\nRobert Jason Owens, 36, is facing multiple charges related to their deaths .\nHe was a 'primary suspect' in the 2000 disappearance of Zebb Quinn, 18 ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "A Florida man has captured astonishing video that shows an intelligent manatee drinking from a garden hose like a straw. The hose was hanging over the edge of a dock in Miami Beach when the 'sea cow' approached and 'grabbed' onto it with its flippers. It then shoves the end of the hose into its mouth to get its refreshing fill of fresh water, which it requires to survive. Even though manatees are found in salt water, they do not consume it. The large 'sea cow' swims over to the long blue hose in order to get its much-needed fresh water intake . Filmed from the end of the dock, the manatee can be seen in the water below holding onto a long blue hose with its flippers. It takes a drink from it as the video maker, Lawrence Schiffman, tells the people with him: ‘I like how he uses his arm to put it into his mouth.’ The video shows the marine mammal dropping the hose and swimming after it. Debating whether the manatee is a he or she, and deciding to go with the latter, Mr Schiffman continues to give a play-by-play of the animal’s actions. The video concludes with the obviously thirsty marine mammal still clutching onto the hose, guzzling water running from an unidentified source. The manatee can be seen using its flipper to grab the hose before it puts it into its mouth like a straw . Manatees are very large, fully aquatic and mostly herbivorous marine mammals. Studies suggest that they must have some access to fresh water for proper regulation of the salt within their bodies. This means that on average they must return to fresh water every one to two weeks to get their fill. Manatees ingest water through actively drinking as well as eating aquatic plants, and are able to move freely between marine environments.", "answer": ["The 'sea cow' uses its flippers to hold onto the long hose at Miami Beach .\nFootage shows manatee taking the hose into its mouth and guzzling water .\nManatees return to fresh water once every one to two weeks .\nEven though they are found in salt water they do not consume it ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "It was a familiar feeling when David Strettle found himself being towered over by the 6ft 6in Per Mertesacker at Arsenal’s London Colney training ground. The Saracens winger, who was on the books of Manchester City as a teenager, had to give up his ambition of becoming a professional footballer because he was ‘too small’ to make the grade. Ironically, the dream of playing at Wembley transpired through rugby, but an afternoon with Mertesacker, Olivier Giroud and Wojciech Szczesny provided a taste of what might have been. David Strettle (far left) poses with Saracens team-mates during a visit to meet Arsenal players . ‘They all dwarfed us, but gone are the days where you have people like Julian Dicks and Vinnie Jones running around in midfield,’ said Strettle at a sponsors’ cross-code challenge day. ‘I was always a better footballer at school — Andrei Kanchelskis was my idol — but I wasn’t big enough to make it with City. That’s when rugby took over at about 16. ‘It’s funny how both games have changed. Now you’ve got your Iniestas and your Messis: small guys who are so skilful.’ Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud signs a doll for Strettle during a visit to London Colney on Friday . David Strettle scores a try to help Saracens to LV= Cup glory over Exeter Chiefs last weekend . Strettle draws comparisons between the northern and southern hemisphere games, highlighting the superior skillset of forwards in New Zealand and Australia. Their lighter emphasis on the breakdown, he says, forces the big men to stand out in the backline and become more clinical in attack. The record-breaking final weekend of the RBS 6 Nations bucked the trend and, having seen England beat France in a 90-point thriller, Strettle feels more needs to be done to spice up the competition. ‘You need to bring in the bonus point to discourage that conservativeness,’ he said.

The Saracens wing attempts a scissor kick during a visit to Arsenal's training ground at London Colney . Strettle, who faces his former housemate Danny Care of Harlequins at Wembley on Saturday, topped the Aviva Premiership try count last season, while this campaign he is ahead of all of England’s Six Nations wingers. Yet it is approaching two years since he played the last of his 14 Tests and he has learned not to wait by the phone on the day of Stuart Lancaster’s squad announcements. Jack Nowell and Anthony Watson ended the Six Nations as England’s first-choice widemen, but Strettle, 31, has been surprised at the amount of chopping and changing — with Jonny May and Semesa Rokoduguni both drifting in and out. David Strettle last played for England in the Test against  Argentina on June 8, 2013 . ‘There’s a situation where someone gets dropped after one bad game,’ said Strettle. ‘Then another player comes in and then it’s back to the start again. ‘It’s the coach’s prerogative but this close to the World Cup I can’t get my head around the fact someone is starting one week and not in the squad a couple of weeks later. ‘I’ve learned not to hold my breath about getting picked. My performances show I warrant consideration, but you just have to do your best and then it’s out of your hands. So long as I’ve got the respect of my peers and team-mates, I’m happy.'

{"question": "(CNN)Police in Mesa, Arizona, know some things about Ryan Elliot Giroux, accused in a string of shootings that left one man dead and five people wounded. He's 41, has an extensive criminal record and served time in prison, according to online inmates records. He's on probation. Giroux used to have tattoos indicating white supremacist beliefs on his face but apparently had them removed, according to photos. One thing investigators don't know: What caused Giroux to allegedly go on a deadly rampage. On Thursday morning, Giroux made his first court appearance. He faces multiple charges, including murder, armed robbery with a deadly weapon, kidnapping, aggravated assault and burglary. The prosecutor requested $2 million bond and the judge imposed it. Grioux has been sent to prison twice for felonies, including an attempt to commit aggravated assault. He was sentenced to seven years and six months behind bars in July 2007, but was released in October 2013, according to online inmate records. His probation runs through October 2016. He also had a run-in with authorities in Santa Monica, California. He allegedly committed assault with a knife in the early morning hours of March 26, 2006, and was detained by witnesses, said Santa Monica Police spokesman Sgt. Rudy Camarena. Giroux was arrested on accusations of attempted murder and parole violation, but police records weren't immediately clear on how the case was resolved, Camarena said Thursday. Police are looking for a motive in the first shooting on Wednesday, but say the other violence happened as the suspect tried to rob people and get away from authorities. The first shots were fired after the suspect got into an argument at the Tri-City Inn with three people that he likely knew, according to Det. Esteban Flores of the Mesa police. One man shot at the Tri-City Inn died, Flores said. Police identified him as David James Williams, 29, reported CNN affiliate KNXV. The motel is across the street from the East Valley Institute of Technology. According to a police press release, the suspect next shot a man during a carjacking at a nearby restaurant and drove away in a stolen Honda Accord. Grioux tried to carjack another vehicle but failed, police said, and crossed the street to break into an apartment, where he shot and tried to rob a fifth person. He went to another apartment complex and shot a sixth person, police said, before fleeing to a condominium complex. Flores said Mesa's SWAT team found Grioux in a vacant second-floor condo. Police used a Taser stun gun to subdue him. Police said one man is in critical condition at a hospital, KNXV reported. The other victims, including the mother of the slain man, were treated and released from hospitals, KNXV reported. Authorities on Thursday released a photo of a bruised Giroux in which he had a tattoo on his neck but no tattoos on his face. An Arizona Department of Correction's photo released earlier showed a heavily tattooed Giroux, with the words \"Skin\" and \"head\" tattooed over his eyebrows. The number 88 was on his left temple, with additional ink on his chin and neck. \"Those are typical tattoos that you do see sometimes on white supremacists, but we don't know if that has anything to do with what happened today,\" Flores said. Neo-Nazis use the number 88 as an abbreviation for \"Heil Hitler.\"  H is the eighth letter in the alphabet, so the Nazi salute becomes 88 in shorthand. Flores said he believes all of the shooting victims were white, with one being white and of Hispanic descent. \"I have no information that his (Giroux's) affiliations or beliefs had anything to do with what occurred today,\" Flores said. News of the shootings caught the attention of the state's senior U.S. senator. \"My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and families impacted by the tragedy in Mesa today,\" U.S. Sen. John McCain said in a statement released Wednesday.  \"Our deepest thanks are with the Valley police and first responders who assisted the victims and tracked down the perpetrator to bring this dangerous situation to an end.\" Mesa is about 20 miles east of Phoenix and is Arizona's third-largest city.

[She crosses one foot behind the other in her now-signature pose.]' Kendall went on to explain: 'You have to keep moving your feet!' Although this seems rather counter-intuitive, the point is to never keep the pressure on the ball of one foot for too long, but rather to regularly shift the weight to alleviate the pain.

{"question": "The grieving family of a Turkish prosecutor who died after being shot in the head and chest during courthouse siege wept over his coffin at his funeral today. Thousands of people gathered on the streets of Istanbul to pay their respects to Mehmet Selim Kiraz, who died yesterday after the six-hour stand-off. His coffin was covered with the Turkish flag for his funeral at Eyup Sultan Mosque in Istanbul. Mr Kiraz died in hospital after the members of the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front stormed into the office and took him hostage. It is not known who fired the fatal shots. Scroll down for video . Threat: The Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front published disturbing photographs of the terrified prosecutor with a gun to his head on their official Facebook page before he was shot . Grief: The family of Mehmet Selim Kiraz grive over his coffin during his funeral at Eyup Sultan Mosque in Istanbul, Turkey. He died in hospital after he was taken hostage by the far-left organisation . Mourning: The coffin of the prosecutor was passed through the crowds of mourners gathered to pay their respects. He had been leading an investigation into the death of teenager Berkin Elvan, who died aged 15 . Two of his captors were killed after security forces took back the building where the far-left group were holding him. Gunshots were heard and smoke could be seen rising from the scene at the end of the six-hour stand-off. Turkish authorities on Wednesday detained 22 suspected members of the group in the southern city of Antalya after receiving a tip-off they were planning further attacks, the Dogan news agency reported. Meanwhile hundreds of lawyers, prosecutors and staff stood in respect on every floor of the giant Istanbul Caglayan Palace of Justice where Kiraz worked and the hostage drama unfolded. 'We will not forget you, our martyr,' read a gigantic banner, as a huge Turkish flag was hung from the top floor. The courthouse is to be renamed after Kiraz. Respect: Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu (L), the son of killed prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz (C) and Turkish National Assembly President Cemil Cicek (R) stand by Kiraz' coffin in Istanbul . Gathering: Prosecutors, lawyers and judges stand near a statue of Lady Justice during the funeral ceremony . Defiant: Mourners at the funeral of Kiraz hold a picture of the prosecutor high in tribute to the lawyer . Mr Kiraz was targeted for his part in an investigation into the death of Berkin Elvan. The 15-year-old was severely wounded after being hit on the head by a tear-gas canister fired by a police officer during anti-government protests in Istanbul in June 2013. After spending 269 days in a coma, Elvan eventually died on March 11 last year. His death, and the subsequent investigation, have since become a rallying point for the country's far-Left. Police chief Selami Altınok said officers stormed the building on Tuesday after hearing gunshots, and killed two of the gunmen. Critical: Prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz was taken to hospital with gunshot wounds but died of his injuries . Shattered: The broken window of the room where prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz was held hostage and shot . 'We carried out the negotiation for six hours. But our security forces launched the operation after gunshots were heard while terrorists were speaking on the phone during the negotiation,' he said. The emergency began at 2.36pm local time (12.36 GMT) when members of the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front stormed into the office of Mr Kiraz. Images of a masked militant holding a gun to Mr Kiraz's head were then posted on the group's Facebook page, along with a demand for police to confess on live TV within the hour. Armed police rushed to the scene and were shown escorting court officials out of the building, but there was no sign of Mr Kiraz before the deadline arrived and live TV feeds were cut. Shots were then heard from inside the building, according to the Dogan news agency. Standing guard: Members of security forces stand outside the main courthouse in Istanbul during the siege . Horror: The prosecutor was leading an investigation into the death of 15-year-old Berkin Elvan . Protesters: Turkish police use water cannons to disperse protesters who expressed support for an alleged militant member of the banned leftist group DHKP-C group who took Turkish Mehmet Selim Kiraz hostage . In a statement published by Turkish media, the hostage taking was claimed by the Marxist Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front, which has been behind a string of recent attacks. The group published pictures showing one of the militants - his face concealed by a scarf with the group's red and yellow insignia - holding a gun to Kiraz's head. They had also plastered their flags and posters on the walls of his office. Turkish media said that the group had given a deadline of 3:36 pm (13.36 BST) for the prosecutor to identify the police officers who they say were behind the killing of Elvan or he would be shot. Emergency: An ambulance leaves the courthouse after police storm the building. Mr Kiraz was taken to hospital where he died from his injuries . Over: Istanbul Security Chief Selami Altinok, centre-right, and Deputy Chief Prosecutor Orhan Kapici speak to the media outside the main courthouse in Istanbul at the end of the siege . In a brief video message on a widely-followed Twitter account describing itself as that of Elvan's family, his father appeared to call on the group not to harm the prosecutor. 'We want justice. We don't want anyone to shed even a drop of blood. We don't want other mothers to cry,' Sami Elvan said. Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu met with the current and former interior and justice ministers at the ruling AK Party headquarters in Ankara to discuss the hostage taking, officials in his office said. The DHKP-C said on its website it wanted the police officer it blames for Elvan's death to 'confess' on television, the officers involved to be tried in 'people's courts', and charges against those who attended protests for Elvan to be dropped. The DHKP-C blames the ruling AK Party for the killing of teenager Elvan. Moving in: Armed police massed outside the Istanbul courthouse . Rushed to safety: Court officials were seen being escorted to safety by armed police . Gunshots: According to the Dogan news agency, gunshots were heard from inside the building after the militant group's deadline passed . Demands: The group were demanding that Mr Kiraz name the policemen implicated in Mr Elvan's death, which has become a rallying point for the country's far-left . He was aged 15 at the time of his death, which was followed by mass nationwide protests that were also largely put down by the police. Elvan has since become an icon for the Turkish far-left and his supporters accuse the authorities of covering up the circumstances and perpetrators of his death. The United States, European Union and Turkey list the DHKP-C as a terrorist organisation. It was behind a suicide bombing at the U.S. Embassy in 2013. In 2001, two policemen and an Australian tourist died in a DHKP-C attack in central Istanbul. Innocent: Berkin was on his way to buy bread during anti-government street protests when he was struck in the head by a high-velocity gas canister .

{"question": "(CNN)Boko Haram, the Nigeria-based Islamist terror group, has pledged allegiance to ISIS, according to an audio message purported to be from Boko Haram's leader, Abubakar Shekau. In the audio, which was posted online Saturday, the speaker says Boko Haram is announcing its \"allegiance to the Caliph of the Muslims, Ibrahim ibn Awad ibn Ibrahim al-Husseini al-Qurashi,\" which is another name for ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. CNN has not been able to independently authenticate the message. But Jacob Zenn, an expert on the terror group and is with the Jamestown Foundation, said the recording appeared to be authentic. He said that while other messages have been faked, the speaker in this one is Shekau. \"Boko Haram joining the ISIS fold makes sense to both groups,\" he said from Abuja, Nigeria. \"Boko Haram will get legitimacy, which will help its recruiting, funding and logistics as it expands into (French-speaking) West Africa. It will also get guidance from ISIS in media warfare and propaganda. Previously Boko Haram was a sort of outcast in the global Jihadi community. Now it is perhaps ISIS's biggest affiliate. \"ISIS gets more international legitimacy as a global caliphate.\" Zenn said the allegiance will be official when an ISIS leader such as spokesman Abu Mohammed al Adnani issues a statement. Boko Haram has had two main factions -- one led by Shekau and the other comprising former members of  Ansaru, a Boko Haram offshoot. Ansaru had been operating from around 2012 as the Nigerian wing of AQIM (al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb). After the French-led intervention in Mali in 2013, a significant number of Ansaru members re-integrated with Shekau, Zenn told CNN. The prerequisite for Boko Haram joining ISIS coalition was a coming together of two factions. ISIS connected with former Ansaru fighters within Boko Haram and pressed them to further unify the group's ranks. The result was the formation of a unity general command between the two factions. That involved bridging of some ideological differences between the al Qaeda-like Ansaru and the ultra extreme \"takfiri\"-like Shekau. The pledge follows a period during which Shekau's faction had been mimicking ISIS, including praising al-Baghdadi and featuring his image in their videos and photos. Zenn said that until recently there had been little feedback from ISIS, apart from a few references to Nigerian jihadis in recent issues of the English-language Dabiq magazine. It appears that a month ago ISIS set up a Twitter account on which Saturday's message was linked, Zenn said. The Twitter handle was mutually promoted by Boko Haram and ISIS. In July, Shekau voiced support for ISIS, and declared a overtaken town in northeast Nigeria to be part of an Islamic caliphate. But he also said he was praying for al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri and Taliban leader Mullah Omar. U.S. intelligence officials have some doubts the two groups would get along. The CIA's analysis has been that Boko Haram is very African and rooted in that region's Islamic practices, even if they have similar fundamentalist interpretations of Islam.  And ISIS's Arab leadership and membership tends to have racist attitudes toward blacks, not unlike the society they come from.

{"question": "(CNN)There are many things that immigrants could teach those of us who are U.S.-born. The biggest lesson may simply to be grateful for our rights and privileges. That includes the little things we take for granted. Like a small plastic card that not only allows us to drive on public roadways but also provides us a sense of identity. Imagine not having a driver's license and not being able to obtain one because the government prohibits it. Erika Andiola doesn't have to imagine. Until recently, the 27-year-old Phoenix resident and co-director of the Arizona Dream Coalition was barred from having a driver's license by Arizona. The reason: she is an undocumented immigrant born in Mexico and brought here as a child by her mother. Given that she arrived in the United States when she was 11 and has lived on this side of the U.S.-Mexico border longer than she lived on the other side, Andiola considers herself an American and this country her home. Under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which was initiated by the Obama administration, more than half a million undocumented youth were given a two-year reprieve from deportation and a work permit. Andiola is one of the recipients, having been granted DACA protection in November 2012 and a renewal since then. From that point, had she lived in another state, the process for getting a driver's license might have been much smoother. But she lives in Arizona, which -- in the 20 years from 1989 to 2009 -- welcomed illegal immigrants and their labor to build homes in Phoenix, work in restaurants in Tucson and make beds at ski lodges in Flagstaff but then tried to expel them when their chores were done. To push them out the door, legislators passed a spiteful law in 2010 that roped local police into enforcing federal immigration statutes and essentially sanctioned ethnic profiling of Latinos. In August 2012, on the same day that DACA took effect, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer issued an executive order preventing the program's recipients from obtaining driver's licenses or other public \"benefit.\" Brewer's order was challenged in court. Two years later, in July 2014, a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the Arizona policy as a violation of the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution. With that, the estimated 22,000 DACA recipients who are also residents of the Grand Canyon State were free to apply for driver's licenses and take their driving tests like anyone else. Andiola got her Arizona license earlier this month, after paying a $25 fee that she'll have to pay every two years each time she renews it. I wondered what traveling that road taught her about that piece of plastic she carries with her. And I was curious about whether she had given any thought to how the native-born see driver's licenses compared to people like her. \"There is a pretty big difference,\" Andiola said. \"I think it's because we fought really hard for it. People born here might not ever think about their driver's license unless they buy a drink or get stopped by police. For us, it's a reminder of the fruits of our labor. Think about how many minds we had to change so people could come out of the shadows.\" Other privileges get taken for granted by the native-born, she said, such as the ability to apply for financial aid to attend college or pay the lower in-state tuition that you're entitled to pay as a state resident. \"When it comes to higher education, I don't think a lot of people really understand what they have unless they have to struggle to get it,\" Andiola said. \"I have nephews who are citizens. I'm trying to make them understand how it was such a big deal, in my case, to attend college and pay in-state tuition and have it taken away. It was a big hurdle, and I almost dropped out. I want them to understand some of the privileges they have.\" Finally, there's the right to vote. Undocumented immigrants can't do it, and yet many of those U.S. citizens who can don't bother going to the polls. \"Look at what we've done to bring change,\" she said. \"Imagine how much someone can accomplish when they vote. A lot of Americans don't learn the political process. And you don't feel you need to until you struggle to drive, to vote, to just be allowed to stay with your family.\" Listen to her, America. This is an exemplary country, and it'll stay that way as long as those of us who were born here and have these rights and privileges learn to appreciate them, treat them with care and put them to good use.", "answer": ["Ruben Navarrette: A driver's license is not only about transportation but about identity .\nHe says it took a hard fight for young immigrants to win the right to driver's licenses in Arizona ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "(CNN)The image of the braided Kurdish female fighter, donning military camouflage and taking up arms against the militant group ISIS, may have done more to promote the Kurdish cause in the West than anything else in recent years. The Iraqi Kurds have long been pro-Western in orientation, but Western powers have often only moderately addressed their pleas for support, in part out of fear of empowering the secessionist minority to seek independence. Now, with soccer moms in Middle America tweeting photos of Kurdish female fighters, Western governments may find it harder to explain their tepid Kurdish policies to their constituencies. Jacob Russell's sensitive photo essay brings much-needed nuance to the recent proliferation of images of Kurdish female fighters. Since last summer, international media -- and Kurdish politicians who have recognized the public relations value of the images -- often objectified these women. Images of smiling young female fighters brandishing weapons with a hint of glamour (\"girls with guns,\" as Russell calls this type of portrayal) tend to portray more of the photographer's assumptions about the woman's emancipation than her actual experiences as a Kurdish woman in combat. Russell consciously avoids this uncomplicated portrayal of female fighters. \"I was wary of making images that fed into this idea of the heroic strong women fighters,\" he said. \"I think that the female fighters are used quite cynically by Kurdish leaders (who) know very well how attractive this image is to the Western media.\" Having lived in Kurdistan for nearly two years, Russell understands that many women join the Peshmerga or other Kurdish forces for unglamorous reasons. Many of the women he photographed turned to the Peshmerga to escape abusive marriages or other forms of repression women continue to face there. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. \"A lot of the women's backstories were quite difficult,\" he said. \"It seemed like this unit provided an alternative network for women who maybe would struggle in normal Kurdish society, because despite being relatively progressive (within the Middle East), it is still quite a conservative society.\" Russell explores the theme of sisterhood, and in one image he captures the women in an intimate moment in the back of a pickup truck, their fingers intertwined. That photo, he says, is his favorite from the shoot. \"I think that image is one of the more expressive ones that (shows) what really seems to be going on there,\" he said. \"I didn't want to take pictures that conveyed the idea that this was all about hardcore fighters going into battle and killing lots of (ISIS) fighters. That just didn't seem to be the case.\" Russell remarks that the image of the female fighter carries an important social role, conveying to the world the (relatively) progressive values that Kurds pride themselves on. The women now serve a political role, too. As Western governments eye more military engagement with Kurdish forces in Iraq and Syria, these women may boost the Kurds' international standing.

{"question": "Winston Churchill planned to tempt America into joining World War Two by offering the country a priceless copy of the Magna Carta. The British Cabinet believed the gesture would sway US public opinion in favour of joining the fighting in Europe, and even set a date for the handover before the deal fell through. Never-before-seen letters reveal the wartime government discussed how Americans are desperate for 'tangible evidence of their European background', meaning the gift would be of particular value. Letters written in 1941 reveal Churchill planned to gift the US a copy of the Magna Carta to persuade them to join World War Two, noting that Americans desire 'tangible evidence of their European background' The Magna Carta, which was issued by King John in 1215 establishing the rule of law and handing rights to his subjects, is also seen as a precursor to the American Constitution. In 1941, when the letters were written, a copy of the document was stranded in America following the outbreak of the war while it was on display at the New York World's Fair in 1939. The US government had already signed a deal sending vast amounts of aid money over to their struggling allies in Europe, but were still reticent about engaging in the fighting themselves. According to the letters, which go on display at the British Library from this Friday, the Americans saw the British as 'cold-blooded', 'calculating' people who failed 'to say it with flowers' The historic document (pictured), which signed over righta King John's people, is viewed as a precursor to the American constitution, and so was viewed as a generous gift . In an attempt to win them over, the British Cabinet, supported by Churchill, planned to gift them the copy of the Magna Carta, which belonged to Lincoln Cathedral. The letters, reported in The Independent, say: 'A friendly act, graciously performed, evokes a tremendous response; when an American has his emotions stirred, his generosity is unbounded. 'He will give the shirt off his back for friendship.' Officials even scheduled June 15 of that year as the day for the document to be handed over, but the deal fell through for unspecified reasons.

{"question": "Some of us are not obvious cruisers. I have an irrational fear of death by drowning and can't bear the thought of eating three meals a day, every day. So the prospect of a 16-day voyage round New Zealand to Australia is alarming. Will I survive? Or will I disappear overboard, laden with food, the heavyweight victim of some marine disaster? New Zealand is a living geography lesson - a country strewn with mountains, fjords, forests, glaciers, and lakes, home to the dolphin, whale, penguin, albatross, seal and sea-lion (there is a difference: the latter eat the former for breakfast). A place to pause: The tiny port of Picton is a gateway to the winelands of New Zealand's Marborough region . Home, too, to the beautiful blue agapanthus flower and the crimson-flowered pohutukawa, the New Zealand Christmas tree. And you can get oysters everywhere. It's a long journey to New Zealand, so make sure you find somewhere to recover. The Boatshed on Waiheke Island, a short ferry ride from Auckland, is perfect - a boutique hotel on the water where you can begin your acquaintance with this faraway land. I'm taken on an exhilarating ride around the bay on a Harley Davidson - 1800cc of shiny, macho metal. 'Have you ridden an HD before?' asks my hunky 'chauffeur'. No, but I used to have a Lambretta 125. Coming back for more: A high percentage of people on the Seabourn Odyssey are returning passengers . 'Just lean when I lean,' he says. I cling to his leathered waist and watch the world go by at speed. My cruising worries begin to evaporate when I meet the crew of Seabourn Odyssey. 'Welcome home,' they say as we embark - a curious choice of words, until you realise more than half the passengers are returnees. In our ship-shape suite, everything is sparklingly clean (as a woman who enjoys scrubbing her front steps, I notice these things). Captain Cook charted the coastline of New Zealand 245 years ago. As well as unpredictable seas, he feared scurvy, caused by a lack of Vitamin C, which leads to suppurating wounds, loss of teeth and ultimately death. No danger of that on the Odyssey. I can't think of another period in my life when I've eaten so well, so consistently. Cook pulped plants to make vitamin beer and fed his men sauerkraut; I sip a glass of champagne and nibble a canapé. That night the whoosh of waves against the hull lulls me to sleep. Taken for a ride: Sue took a tour of Waiheke island in speedy two-wheeled style - on a Harley Davidson . The ship has 450 passengers, 11 decks, four restaurants, a spa, fitness centre, swimming pool, hot tubs everywhere and a theatre larger than Cook's ship. On day one, we disembark andhead for Rotorua and its strange geothermal pools. 'Tours4Matures' says a minibus sign — a reminder of the age profile. We hire a car and drive to see bubbling mud, hot volcanic craters and hissing ochre and green waters. But why would you take a bath in mud and risk getting it where even the soap can't reach? We get lost driving back and nearly miss the sailing. Independence comes at a price. Crossing the Cook Strait to South Island, we anchor at the tiny port of Picton and take an excursion into the Marlborough High Country, to a remote sheep station where we meet Hailey Pitts. She and her husband Jeremy farm 20,000 acres and rear 5,000 sheep. It's a hard life, but their shining eyes are proof that they adore it. As we cruise through Queen Charlotte Sound, said to be Captain Cook's favourite anchorage, peace envelops me. I sit on our veranda watching the sun fade across the islands around us. What a long way from the remote outdoors of that sheep station. Idyllic: Waiheke island sits on Auckland's doorstep - but feels far removed from New Zealand's biggest city . Ah, well - what's for dinner? In Akaroa, we see Hector's dolphin, the smallest and rarest in the world. In Port Chalmers, we climb up to a memorial to Captain Robert Scott. He set sail from there in 1910 on his illfated journey to the South Pole. The sunset is spectacular that night and I think of Captain Scott and his companions as the red ball in the sky disappears, leaving behind a trail of light, first pink, then orange, then burgundy, until finally blackness falls. (Trying to describe a sunset is like trying to describe sex - it always sounds trite. Let's just say it was moving.) On south, until we hit the last land before the South Pole, the beautiful Stewart Island. Due west - nothing but sea until the tip of South America. Due east - ditto. It's time to turn and head out to Australia. It's nearly 1,300 miles from the bottom of New Zealand across the Tasman Sea to Melbourne. Gale force winds mean the ship can make only slow progress as it tries to avoid pitching heavily into the waves. My irrational fears return. The crossing takes three long days and nights, But I come to realise how a big ship like the Odyssey can cope with such seas. I relax into the camaraderie that develops on board, and at long last we're cruising into Melbourne and then along the coast to Sydney. Calm comforts: Picton is a haven for sailors who have crossed the often rough waters of the Cook Strait . At 6am on a beautiful summer's morning, the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge welcome us to a city full of promise. That afternoon, I watch from my hotel window as the Seabourn Odyssey sets sail once more, back to Auckland. Now someone else is in suite 722. Someone else is being made to feel this is a voyage designed only for them. I confess to feeling proprietorial and not a little emotional. I must be a cruiser. A 16-day Australia and New Zealand cruise on the Seabourn Encore (0843 373 2000, seabourn.com), departing on February 2, 2017, costs from £7,999 per person, based on two people sharing. This price is cruise-only and includes all food and a selection of fine wines and spirits on board.

{"question": "A major player in online travel has finally 'fallen into line' by removing excess credit card charges two years after the Royal Bank of Australia ruled that surcharges should be limited to ‘reasonable costs’. Online booking agent Wotif confirmed they are dumping their $5.50 hotel booking fee which could put some $20 million dollars back into the pockets of Australian consumers. They are also removing credit card costs and surcharges on full service flights that would have set consumers back $16.95 however they will keep a surcharge on low cost airlines of $9.95 per person. Wotif have dumped excess booking fees which could save Australians $20 million a year . While Wotif has been praised for the move, consumers who expected to see a drop in prices  may be disappointed as the company is believed to have increased the commission levied on accommodation for bookings made via its website from 12 to 15 per cent, reported Newscorp. Tom Godfrey thinks there needs to be a regulatory body to stop companies from charging exorbitant prices for using a credit card or booking online . Tom Godfrey from CHOICE told Daily Mail Australia that an increase in commission prices could be an effort to further 'fleece' customers in a bid to offset losses from dropping the controversial credit card fees. Wotif said the change is not a bid to recoup costs lost by the surcharge but a reflection on their recent acquisition by competing company Expedia. Mr Godfrey said the rise in commission will increase up front costs of travel however the removal of the credit card surcharging is win for consumers and a clear warning to other companies who continue to ‘flout’ the ban on excessive charges. ‘It’s great to see consumers unite to drive change because it sends clear signal to businesses that we aren't happy.’ He said excessive credit card charges are costing Australian’s over a billion dollars a year, with some of the ‘worst offenders’ being Qantas, Jetstar, Virgin and Tiger. ‘People are sick and tired of being ripped off by the top end of town,' he said. Klaus Bartosch, the business man responsible for an anti surcharge petition that's been signed by over 100,000 people, welcomes the change and agrees this move puts more pressure on other major players to respond to 'consumer sentiment' by removing 'outrageous fees'. 'No where else in the world does this exist,' he said. Mr Bartosch started an online petition to stop airlines and travel companies from taking advantage of consumers by charging 'ridiculous' amounts for using credit cards . Mr Bartosch said prices are 'misleading' and not an accurate reflection of what businesses are actually paying to use credit cards. 'They are just plucking these figures from their backsides to rip of consumers,' he told Daily Mail Australia. CHOICE recently released a report that shows merchants are only paying around 0.8 per cent for Visa and Mastercard and 2 per cent for prestige cards like America Express and Diners Club. According to the latest research data made available by MasterCard, Australian consumers are being surcharged about $1.6 billion each year. Qantas, Tiger, Jetstar and Virgin continue to flout the ban on excessive credit card surcharges . Mr Bartosch believes these numbers prove that Australian's are facing excessive surcharges and that companies 'can not be trusted to self regulate'. CHOICE have also called for a regulator who have explicit legal power to limit credit card surcharges. According to Mr Godfrey excessive surcharging needs to be regulated by a body with the power to demand evidence of fair pricing and subsequently enforce significant penalties for non compliance. 'For too long hotels and airlines have been thumbing their nose at the government and there needs to be a regulatory body who have more power to enforce the ban,' Mr Godfrey said.", "answer": ["Wotif have removed a controversial $5.50 credit card surcharge .\nThis comes two years after the RBA banned excessive surcharging .\nWatchdog CHOICE said this is great news for consumers .\nThey say this will pressure other major players to drop unfair fees .\nWhile surcharging has been removed, Wotif increased commission rates .\nSome critics say this is to offset the loss of the surcharge ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "Kim Sears waited eight years for a proposal from Andy Murray, Mariah Carey accepted Nick Cannon’s offer of marriage after one month. How long it takes you to get married is entirely individual but when one person is gagging to get up the aisle and the other has no intention of going there, there are clearly questions that need answering. Staying with someone who’s using you as a stop-gap until their ‘true’ love comes along isn’t healthy; staying with someone who loves you but doesn’t want to get married for justifiable reasons is entirely different. Tracey Cox reveals the signs to look out for to work out whether your partner is 'the one' But how do you know who’s holding out for better and who’s genuine, albeit marriage shy? There are the seven key questions to consider, according to relationship therapists - and two you need to ask yourself. 1. What’s their background and relationship history? It is often used as an excuse but the ‘I don’t believe in the institution of marriage - it’s just a ‘piece of paper’’ is understandable if based on past experience. A previous failed marriage can make people cynical about a repeat performance. If your partner’s parents had a toxic marriage, treated each other badly and were desperately unhappy, it’s hardly surprising they’re not keen to follow in their footsteps. Their fear isn’t about getting married, it’s fear of it ending in a messy, painful divorce. Are they happy discussing marriage even if not happy doing it? If you can’t sit down and have an open, honest discussion with someone you love about something that is important to you, you shouldn’t be marrying them in the first place. If a partner refuses to even talk through the topic, it shows a distinct lack of interest in you and your feelings which isn’t a great indicator for a healthy, long-term relationship. 2. Can they tell you the reason why they’re not interested? It’s a huge red flag if their answer to ‘Why don’t you want to marry me?” is “I don’t know”. Usually one of two things is going on. They’re avoiding telling the truth - they don’t want to marry you - or it suggests a lack of self-awareness and ability to articulate feelings. Neither are indicative of a healthy functioning relationship. 3. Do they have a problem with the actual ceremony? One couple I knew nearly split because the guy refused to discuss marriage even though he was desperately in love with his partner. He nearly lost her before admitting that, as a shy person, the thought of being the centre of attention and having to make a speech in front of dozens of people scared him witless. Think about anything else about the ceremony they might be dreading. 4. Does the thought of all their family being together in one room make them want to run for the hills? Tracey says that being to optimistic could be a sign that your relationship is in danger . Offer up some alternatives - a registry office, garden party with a few friends, just the two of you away somewhere, writing your own vows instead of repeating words that might mean nothing to them - and see what response you get. 5. Is it about money? I’m not just talking about who will finance the wedding but what happens after that. Men, particularly, will often put off getting married until they feel financially secure. Even they intellectually know we live in (more) equal times, that inbuilt male desire to want to provide can kick in with the most ‘feminised’ man at times like this. 6. Are they worried getting married might ruin a good relationship? We’ve all heard of couples who finally marry after more than a decade only to split a few months later. Usually this is because the relationship was failing and getting married was a last-ditch attempt to save it, given all the history shared. But to someone who is thoroughly enjoying the relationship they have now, seeing others fail is a reason to be nervous. Why fix it, if it isn’t broken?, they reason. Some personalities are better suited to living together than marriage. Some see marriage as security, comfort, an expression of deep and lasting love. Others see it as suffocating, claustrophobic and stifling. They might be very happy to live with you forever without being formally ‘forced’ to stay but find the thought of ‘having’ to stay unappealing. 7. Are they happy committing, if not getting married? Don’t confuse marriage with commitment. Plenty of couples are committed to each other without being married and being married doesn’t ensure your partner will be committed (or faithful). If they’ll happily chat about things like buying houses, planning holidays, looking after parents in later life and other things that will tie you together for an awfully long time, they have a problem with marriage, not committing to you and your relationship. If your partner clearly loves you, is committed for life but just doesn’t want to get married, does it really matter? Why is marriage important to you? There are many reasons to want to get married. Be honest with yourself about what your motivation is. Do you want to get married for moral or religious reasons? Are you jealous and want to make sure others know your partner’s off limits? Are you doing it because all your friends are and you feel left out? Do you want to send an ‘I’m over you alright!’ message to an ex? Or do you fancy a big party with all your friends and a chance to show off? Are you doing it to boost your self-esteem? The high of planning a wedding and being the envy of others who’d also like to be getting married, works wonders to prop up sagging self-confidence. Until, of course, the wedding is over and everything reverts straight back to what it was with no problem solved and one created if you realise you’re married to the wrong person. How healthy is your relationship? The worst reason of all to get married is thinking it will fix an floundering relationship. Are you pushing for it too soon? If you’ve been together less than six months, it’s more ‘What are you thinking?’ than ‘Slow down’. Yes, of course there are exceptions of couples who marry weeks into their relationship and remain blissfully happy years later. But there are more couples who fall into the ‘marry in haste, repent in leisure’ category. What’s the rush, anyway, if you’re going to be together forever? Most research on marital happiness suggests couples who’ve been together 18 months before getting engaged, then marry within a year, have the best chance at lasting long-term. Statistics are statistics and not always right but this does provide a good yardstick to measure your eagerness by. If you’re suggesting marriage way earlier than most people and your partner’s baulking at the idea, this may actually mean they’re more serious about you, than you are them. While there’s an undeniable romantic appeal to the notion of ‘love at first sight’, is it not more romantic (not to mention sensible) to give your marriage the best possible chance to succeed by waiting a little?", "answer": ["Sex expert reveals how to stop if someone is using you as a 'stop gap'\nExplains two questions to ask about why marriage is important to you .\nAdvises to ask partner why they are not interested in commitment .\nRead more of Tracey’s views at traceycox.com ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "Phil Jagielka has warned Everton team-mate Ross Barkley that he will have to wait patiently for a place in England’s midfield. Barkley was still only 19 years old when he made his England debut in September 2013 and set pulses racing with some of his performances for Everton last season which earned him a place at last summer’s World Cup in Brazil. But this campaign the 21-year-old has struggled for the same kind of form and, despite winning 10 England caps already, does not currently appear to be in Roy Hodgson’s first-team plans. Barkley has been played in multiple positions for club and country and Everton manager Roberto Martinez has experimented the most with him out on the wing, as an attacking central midfielder or further back in the middle. Ross Barkley may have to wait for his chance to impress with England, according to team-mate Phil Jagielka . Jagielka spoke on Wednesday about his club team-mate's progress in what has been a difficult season . The Everton skipper said he believed Barkley would have to bide his time and wait for an opportunity . ‘I think Ross will have to bide his time,’ Jagielka, who is his club captain, said. ‘And when he does get the opportunities for England, keep playing the way he has, keep playing well, keep being positive and hopefully when he gets that chance to play in two or three games on the spin, that is his chance keep the shirt and make it much harder for someone to take it off him. ‘It is difficult with the position he would try to get in the team in. We have got a fantastic amount of midfielders that come away with England and quite a lot who want to play in a similar position.’ One player almost certain of a starting place in the crunch games is goalkeeper Joe Hart.

That culminated in his stand-out performance against Barcelona, in which Lionel Messi described him as ‘phenomenal’ even though he could not prevent City going out of the Champions League. Jagielka, Barkley and the rest of their Everton team-mates watched the match in Kiev ahead of their Europa League tie. ‘We were pretty much laughing at the performance from Joe,’ Jagielka revealed. ‘It was just one of those nights. ’It is sometimes difficult to get the accolades when you're at a big team. It is normally the people scoring the goals and things like that, but when Joe is needed he normally comes up trumps with some fantastic saves or some fantastic decisions in games.'

They climb up a rugged mountain, appearing to cling to its side by their fingernails. Bit by bit, bag by bag, high wire daredevils hoist body bags hundreds of feet up to waiting helicopters, trying to remain stable in the high winds.  Rescuers pin red flags on the earth when they discover new fragments. Winched down from helicopters on to the steep, icy slopes, where debris lies scattered across hundreds of meters, workers have had to be tied together in two-person teams. One is there to carry out the investigation and recovery. The second is charged with ensuring their safety as they're buffeted by the weather. Complicating matters, very few of the bodies have been found whole, Yves Naffrechoux, captain of rescue operations, told CNN on Friday. And winds have picked up, making it difficult for helicopters to ferry the workers to the site in the French Alps in the first place, he said. Authorities have deployed 45 Alpine police officers to help forensics teams -- not accustomed to working in mountain ravines -- recover the bodies safely, Naffrechoux said. His team is based out of Seyne-les-Alpes, a normally sleepy Alpine village that since Tuesday's crash has been transformed into a hub for the recovery operation. The leaders of Germany, France and Spain have visited. The families of the victims have laid flowers and prayed at a nearby memorial. Journalists have flocked to the spot as they report the latest developments. Meanwhile, the rescue workers have continued their hazardous mission. Before anything could be recovered, the position of the bodies and debris had to be mapped. Human remains must be treated with due respect despite the tricky conditions. The workers are now removing more bodies from the site, Naffrechoux said. The priority remains to find all the bodies and the elusive second \"black box,\" the plane's flight data recorder, he said. Investigators hope, once found, it could yield more clues into what happened on the flight deck of the Germanwings plane before it slammed into the mountainside at about 430 miles per hour. Already, the Marseille prosecutor, Brice Robin, has revealed that cockpit audio indicated that German co-pilot Andreas Lubitz \"wanted to destroy the aircraft.\" The recovery teams are trying to construct a road to access the site more quickly and aid the transportation of bodies to a DNA testing center where they are kept in refrigerated units, said Naffrechoux. It's hoped the process will take 10 to 15 days, depending on weather, he said. Testimonials posted by France's Interior Ministry from rescue and recovery workers at the scene also give an insight into the tough conditions at the remote crash site. Cmdr. Emmanuel G., of the Criminal Research Institute from the National Gendarmerie, said it was a \"really complicated\" process. \"We are working in two-person teams, whether it's alongside (police) mountain guides, the local gendarmes or the alpine firemen and emergency teams,\" he said. \"We do not know how to continue in this situation otherwise, we really need them to ensure our security at all times.\" \"It's the first time police technicians and gendarmes are working together,\" an unnamed technician in one of those two-person teams is quoted as saying. \"We have total trust in each other. He's holding my life in his hands.\" CNN's Antonia Mortensen and Nic Robertson reported from Seyne-les-Alpes and Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported from London. CNN's Karl Penhaul,  Ariana Williams and Dheeptika Laurent contributed to this report.", "answer": ["High winds are complicating efforts to recover remains and aircraft debris from the mountainous crash site .\nCaptain of rescue operations tells CNN that very few bodies have been found whole .\nRecovery workers are being winched down in pairs, one to gather remains and the other to ensure safety ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "The self-styled ‘captain’ of a replica German U-boat could face prison after he admitted swindling the taxman out of more than £1million. Captain Birdseye lookalike Richard Williams, 56, spent £50,000 kitting out the vessel, which he named U-8047, with naval artefacts, a periscope and dummy torpedoes. His vessel was moored as a floating visitor attraction at Clarence Dock in Leeds, West Yorkshire, when it was raided by Customs officers. Captain Birdseye? Richard Williams faces jail after admitting avoiding paying more than £1million in taxman . His replica German U-boat was moored at Clarence Dock in Leeds, when it was raided by Customs officers . Now, the self-confessed maritime history enthusiast - who has toured the waterways of Northern Ireland and northern Britain in his boat - is facing prison after admitting to avoiding more than £1million in taxes. An investigation by HM Revenue and Customs dating back to 2012 found Williams and his former partner Laurel Howarth had set up a number of companies in Lancashire. They ostensibly sold disability equipment to care homes and the NHS, but evidence gathered by investigators showed minimal genuine sales actually took place. Despite this, the pair filed false tax returns and invoices for more than £1million. The self-confessed maritime history enthusiast has admitted spending £50,000 kitting out the vessel . The 56-year-old spent the money on naval artefacts, a periscope and dummy torpedoes for the vessel . The 'captain' has toured the waterways of Northern Ireland and northern Britain self-made barge, named U-8047 . Both Williams, of Blackpool, Lancashire, and Howarth, 28, formerly of the same address, hijacked the identities of friends and associates in an attempt to hide the fraud. Williams, also known as Stephen Howarth, was charged under the naval title and a series of other aliases he is claimed to have used - after the raid on his self-made barge in January 2012. In May 2011, Williams spoke to the Mail while touring around the Liverpool waterways dressed in full German submarine commander regalia. He told reporters he was a former mobility scooter salesman and had spent more than £50,000 building the U-boat. He also revealed that the boat had been subject to attack from passers-by who thought that he was a Nazi.

{"question": "Captain Eoin Morgan will not entertain thoughts of a premature World Cup exit even though a nine-wicket defeat by Sri Lanka left England on the brink of disaster. England suffered yet more pain at the Wellington Regional Stadium as centuries from Lahiru Thirimanne and Kumar Sangakkara inspired a record pursuit of 309 for six. Defeat leaves England needing to beat lower-ranked Bangladesh and Afghanistan in their remaining pool games and, even then, it might not be enough to keep them alive. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Cricket World Cup Highlights: England vs Sri Lanka . Eoin Morgan talks to the press after another disappointing defeat for England at the Cricket World Cup . Kumar Sangakkara (centre) hit 117 not out and, alongside Lahiru Thirimanne, put England to the sword . Morgan was not willing to consider the prospect, however, of an early flight home after his side's third loss in four games at the tournament. 'It's not even a thought at the moment,' he said. 'Two games to win to get us into a quarter-final.' Morgan's side never got going in both of those games, but after Joe Root's career-best 121 had put England in the box seat at the half-way stage, the bowlers posed little threat as Thirimanne and Sangakkara embarked on an unbeaten 212-run stand to coast home with 16 balls in hand. 'It definitely is harder to take,' Morgan said. 'When you don't turn up for a race like those first two games it's scratched. Today when we turn up and we're beaten in the fashion we were is harder to take.' One-day captain Morgan (centre) leads England off the pitch in Wellington after their nine-wicket defeat . Thirimanne (left) and Sangakkara helped Sri Lanka to a comfortable win over England in New Zealand . Morgan bemoaned a bowling performance in which he claimed England simply bowled too many bad balls. Thirimanne certainly agreed, after he had suggested in his earlier press conference that batting against England's bowlers had been 'very easy'. The opener was asked to compare England's attack to Afghanistan, who almost pulled off a stunning win over Sri Lanka earlier in the tournament, and said: 'To be honest that day Afghanistan's bowlers did really well but there was a little bit for the seamers. 'Today it was very easy for me to be honest.' Morgan was at a loss to explain why his bowlers were so ineffective and will wait to see a statistical breakdown of England's bowling performance in the next couple of days when they will take time off after flying to Adelaide. Thirimanne plays a shot on the way to scoring a century as Sri Lanka made light work of England's bowlers . Thirimanne is almost down on one knee during his knock (left) as he celebrates with Sangakkara (right) 'No. I don't have a theory yet,' he said. 'We bowled a lot of bad balls. Over the next couple of days we'll get the HawkEye stuff back and the proof will be in that. My feeling is we bowled a lot of bad balls.' The skipper denied that the England attack was too predictable in the light of Thirimanne's observations, adding: 'In terms of being too predictable you look at the best sides and they're predictably good. When we're firing we are predictably good. 'We've got two tall guys who are effective, they've got pace and bounce, and two guys who swing the ball and Moeen who does his job. 'When we bowl well we put sides under pressure and create opportunities - today we didn't.' Root celebrates  after reaching a century against Sri Lanka, but it wasn't enough to secure a win for England . Morgan, post-match, did not entertain thoughts of an early exit, instead remaining confident of progression . England were not helped by missing opportunities in the field, most significantly when Root grassed a chance at first slip off Stuart Broad when Thirimanne was on just three. The Sri Lanka openers then put on a century stand to pave the way for a chase that easily broke the previous record at the ground - 254 for four achieved by South Africa against New Zealand three years ago. 'You can talk about the chances we put down. Thirimanne was one,' Morgan said. 'It would have brought Sangakkara to the wicket earlier with more chance of him getting out. He played well. He came in an ideal situation.' England have now been soundly beaten by the three sides ranked higher than them in the group and, should they reach the knockout stages, there is apparently a large gap to be bridged if they are to make any impression. 'Losing any game is always a concern,' Morgan added. James Taylor drops a catch on the boundary as England failed to build on their score in Wellington . Sangakkara and team-mate Thirimanne shake hands with Morgan after Sri Lanka's nine-wicket win . 'Over the next few days, we'll have them off, and then we'll reconvene. Me and Mooresy will have a sit down along with the backroom staff and debrief the game and see where we've gone wrong and how we can get better.' Morgan is confident, though, that he will have no problem in lifting his young squad who now have an eight-day gap to stew over their latest defeat before they meet Bangladesh at the Adelaide Oval. 'It's not a big deal getting those guys up,' he said. 'It's a World Cup everybody is like a kid at Christmas, they want to play and they want to win. That part of it is easy. 'It's simple things moving forward. I keep banging on about them because we haven't done them so far this World Cup. 'The simpler we keep it moving forward, the more obvious what we do or have to do over the next 10 days. That will be the message from me to the players.'", "answer": ["Sri Lanka beat England by nine wickets at the Cricket World Cup .\nThe defeat leaves England with three losses from their first four matches .\nEoin Morgan will not entertain thoughts of a premature World Cup exit .\nEngland need to beat Bangladesh and Afghanistan in their final two matches, and even that might not be enough to see them through ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "A JetBlue Airways pilot who had to be restrained during a 2012 flight after shouting about Jesus and al-Qaeda  sued for more than $16 million Friday, claiming the airline failed to recognize and address his mental condition. The suit filed by former captain Clayton Osbon three years after his meltdown on a flight from New York to Las Vegas, comes amid increased scrutiny of how major airlines evaluate pilots' mental health in the wake of the allegedly intentional crash of a Germanwings . Osbon, 52, claims in the lawsuit that officials at JetBlue missed several indications that something was wrong with his mental health the day of the flight, noting he missed a pre-flight meeting for the first time in years and arrived to fly disheveled and disoriented. Scroll down for video . Restrained: Clayton Osbon, 52, pictured here being taken off a New York to Las Vegas flight after his breakdown, is suing JetBlue for failing to recognize he was mentally ill . Osbon moved slowly during pre-flight checks for the flight to Las Vegas from New York, and later relieved himself of duty after being told by the first officer he had missed several calls from air traffic control, the lawsuit adds. After a co-pilot locked Osbon out of the cockpit, he 'ran down the aisles screaming and ranting concerning imagined terrorism and the need for all on board on embrace religion.' The lawsuit alleges that JetBlue allowed the flight to continue for three hours and 'unnecessarily endangered the lives of Captain Osbon, the crew and the 135 passengers.' There were no injuries on the flight, which eventually made an emergency landing in Amarillo, Texas. The meltdown resulted from a complex partial brain seizure that 'severely impaired his ability to perform basic activities, caused him to hallucinate, and caused extreme feelings of paranoia and religious fervor,' according to the suit. The lawsuit also alleges the airline routinely ignored crew members' impairment, whether by alcohol, drugs or mental and emotional distress, in order to protect their careers. Hospitalized: Osbon, right, is led out by FBI agents after being released from Northwest Texas hospital in Amarillo following his mid-air breakdown . Veteran captain: Osbon, left, was an experienced pilot but a 'complex partial brain seizure' impaired his brain functions and caused him to hallucinate, according to the lawsuit . Nearly three dozen passengers sued JetBlue in 2012 for being 'grossly negligent' by allowing Osbon to fly with unchecked mental issues. JetBlue eventually settled the lawsuit in April of the following year for an undisclosed sum. After the flight was grounded in Texas, Osbon was indicted on charges of interfering with a flight crew and found not guilty by reason of insanity. Among other conditions of his sentence, Osbon was ordered not to board a commercial or private plane without permission from a probation officer. Osbon remains suspended on medical leave, no longer collecting what once was a more than $300,000 annual salary. The lawsuit states he has not suffered a seizure since beginning a regimen of prescription medication.", "answer": ["Clayton Osbon, 52, claims in a lawsuit the airline failed to recognize signs he was in mental distress before a flight in which he broke down shouting .\nThe lawsuit claims Osbon missed a pre-flight meeting and arrived disheveled .\nThe meltdown was caused by a seizure resulting from a lingering traumatic brain injury that occurred in Osbon's childhood, the lawsuit states .\nAfter relieving himself of duty during the flight, Osbon was locked out of the cockpit .\nHe shouted at passengers about Jesus and al-Qaeda before being tackled and restrained ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "(CNN)As more details about the infamous ISIS executioner \"Jihadi John\" become known, certain basic questions continue to be raised. Is Islam as a faith to be blamed for Mohammed Emwazi's voyage to ISIS, otherwise known as the Islamic State? Or is the \"War On Terror\" responsible, and is this merely \"chickens coming home to roost?\" The temptation is to come to simplistic answers. Confronted with such brazen depravity as shown in ISIS propaganda videos, many take what their propagandists say very seriously: That they are, indeed, doing what their faith tells them to do. On the other hand, few believed ISIS when it was claimed they would negotiate with the Japanese authorities to release one of their citizens captured in Syria, who was later killed. Taking ISIS at their word is probably not the most sensible course of action -- it is obviously quite wrong -- and duplicitous -- about a number of things. There have been other neo-religious movements in both Muslim and Christian history. The \"Assassins,\" for example, which began in the 11th century, was a radical, heterodox movement of Muslims, which eventually died out -- in its own time, similar to ISIS today, it was decried and depicted as deviant by Muslim religious authorities as well as most Muslims. Among Christendom, many of the Nazi leadership in the 20th century espoused an ideology called \"Positive Christianity.\" It obviously never attracted much of a following, and historians claim, \"Only a few radicals on the extreme wing of liberal Protestantism would recognize such a mish-mash as true Christianity.\" Why, then, are we not prepared to expunge Islam from the mix when interrogating ISIS ideology? While most churches, Protestant and Catholic, rejected the \"Positive Christianity\" of Nazi Germany, there is no corresponding action from the world of Islam. The problem is, that's not entirely possible. Unlike Christendom, Islam does not admit a hierarchical, ecclesiastical authority -- so, no \"Muslim Church\" or \"Islamic Pope\" exists. Having said that, nevertheless, there are systems of religious authority in Islam. They are more akin to academic peer review structures -- indeed, the concept of the modern university comes from the medieval Muslim seminary. Since the dawn of ISIS, numerous Muslim religious authorities have denounced the claim to authenticity by ISIS, on religious grounds -- none have given it that prize of legitimacy it so craves. That is, except for ISIS itself, and for some odd reason, some in the West who insist on taking ISIS at its word. Religious authorities at large, and Muslims in general, may recognize ISIS members as Muslims, albeit gravely deviant ones who ought to be treated as criminals. Just as Europeans en masse rejected the claims of Anders Breivik, the Norwegian mass killer, who claimed \"Christianity\" as a motivator, without denying he considered himself to be a Christian. In both cases, it is important to understand how this ideology is internally justified, and on what basis, particularly in terms of establishing methods for immunizing vulnerable people from possible recruitment strategies. That doesn't, nevertheless, entail recognizing their claims as accurate -- only that they take them seriously, and others may too. That question of \"vulnerability\" has also been brought up a great deal in the last couple of weeks. There were some in the UK who argued that Jihadi John was subjected to a type of harassment by the British security services that proved to be a causal factor in his radicalization process. In one interview, the lobby group, Cage Prisoners, insisted in response to a question about responsibility for the beheadings in Syria: \"The man who cut off their heads, and if you take that back a step, the people who potentially helped in his radicalization; in this case, the security services.\" Specialists in the field of radicalization took great exception to the implication, with experts from the likes of Exeter University and Kings College London describing it as \"absurd,\" and \"bizarre.\" Certainly, there are questions to be raised with regards to the British security services -- including how Jihadi John, who was known to them, was allowed to leave the country, as well as how suspects are interrogated and questioned. There shouldn't be any sensitivity about this -- the British security services do the job that they do precisely so Britons live in a society open enough to be able to ask these questions without fear or reprisal. Nevertheless, the suggestion that the British security services somehow radicalized Jihadi John is peculiar. There are many high-profile members of ISIS in Syria and Iraq who underwent no harassment of any sort -- for example, Lotfi Arrifin, a youth leader in a Malaysian political party. There are also many who have undergone far more invasive encounters with other security establishments worldwide, at the hands of authoritarian governments in the Arab world and elsewhere -- they did not suddenly register for service in the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa. Does it make them more vulnerable to possible recruitment? It very well could -- but that's not a foregone conclusion. Otherwise, given the scale of autocratic oppression in recent history, we should have seen far more members of ISIS. There will be those who contend radical Islamist theology is all we need to look at in understanding radicalization -- there will be others who will place all attention on domestic issues such as the security services, or foreign policy. The reality is, however, there is no template for explaining the voyage an individual takes in becoming a member of ISIS or any other radical Islamist group. For different individuals, different factors make them vulnerable to recruitment. More often than not, a recruit will find him or herself looking for some kind of \"meaning\" in this world -- and repugnant though ISIS ideology may be, it does provide a sense of certainty. What makes recruits more attuned to that kind of absolutism as opposed to going down other paths? It may be many things that condition them before they accept radical Islamism as their \"savior.\" In all cases, nevertheless, there are two things we ought to keep foremost in mind. We must understand the context of the paths these recruits go through, to avoid others doing the same -- and we must always keep in mind that regardless of the context, only one person has responsibility for their actions. Each one of them, themselves.", "answer": ["H.A.

{"question": "Jonny Evans' actions in spitting at Papiss Cisse were 'simply disgusting', a Football Association regulatory commission ruled. The written reasons for Evans' six-match ban were released by the FA on Thursday. The Manchester United defender and Newcastle striker Cisse were both charged after spitting at each other during the Red Devils' 1-0 victory on March 4 in an incident missed by referee Anthony Taylor. Newcastle's Papiss Cisse and Manchester United's Jonny Evans squared at St James' Park last week . Cisse has been banned for seven games, while Evans has received a six game suspension . Cisse accepted the charge and a seven-match ban - one extra because of a previous offence this season - but Evans insisted he had not intended to spit at the striker and contested it. The three members of the regulatory commission accepted 27-year-old Evans was the only person who could know his intent, but stated: 'It is clear that Mr Evans is looking directly and indeed aggressively at Mr Cisse. His lips are 'pursed' and he is close to Mr Cisse. 'If he was, as alleged to be the case, a person who 'habitually spits', then the commission were concerned as to why he did not turn his head away from Mr Cisse when so spitting. 'If that had been a family member or indeed another team member or his manager in front and below him would he still have carried out the same manoeuvre? Evans' actions have been described as 'simply disgusting' by the FA's regulatory committee . Both Evans and Cisse were charged and banned by the FA for spitting, but Cisse admitted the offence . 'Mr Evans had (and has) a duty of care, if spitting for whatever reason, not to direct the same in the general direction of an opponent, or indeed anyone else. The video clips clearly show that he failed in his duty of care. 'There may, in some quarters, be substantial sympathy for Mr Evans, but the video evidence shows that he did what he did, and the ordinary man in the street will find his action to be simply disgusting and should not be allowed in any walk of life, let alone on any football field.'

{"question": "Jihadi John dumped two schoolboys on the M1 motorway at gunpoint in revenge for an attack on his brother, it was revealed today. Mohammed Emwazi - unmasked as the killer in the infamous ISIS beheading videos last week - carried out the kidnap during his days living on a notorious housing estate. He and two bearded associates are said to have abducted two gang members accused of beating up his younger brother, Omar, in 2008. Mohammed Emwazi (left) - now unmasked as ISIS killer Jihadi John - reportedly kidnapped two schoolboys and threatened them with a gun after his younger brother Omar (right) was attacked  in 2008 . The brothers were living on the Mozart estate in west London at the time of the incident, which was known for its postcode gang 'the Mozart Bloods'. A former friend of Omar told the Evening Standard today that he went to buy a stolen bike from Emwazi's younger brother in 2008, a time when the now notorious terrorist was still studying at Westminster University. The friend, who was 14 at the time, said he and Omar were then attacked by two teenage members of the 'Bloods', who broke his arm because he was from a different postcode and punched Omar in the face. When Emwazi found out about the incident, he sought revenge on the two schoolboys who had carried out the beating, the source said. He told the London paper: 'They drove round in a car and found these two guys who attacked us, threatened them with a gun, made them take all their clothes off and drove off. 'They dumped them on the M1 motorway. They weren't attacked physically but they were threatened. It was a message.' A former friend of Omar Emwazi say boys who assaulted him and Omar were dumped on the M1 motorway without their clothes in revenge for the violent attack (file picture) Details of Emwazi's links to criminals have emerged since he was unmasked as the ISIS killer last week . The source said Emwazi was not a known gang member at the time but was 'a bit of a hard nut'. Since Emwazi was unmasked as Jihadi John last week,  his links to criminals during his time growing up in London have been exposed. He was known to associate with Choukri Ellekhlifi – a member of a gang which preyed on rich targets in a series of violent attacks and who also later travelled to Syria to join ISIS. The Moroccan-born criminal was thought to have been two years below Emwazi at Quintin Kynaston academy in St John's Wood, North West London, which Omar also attended. It was also revealed last week that Emwazi stood trial twice, accused of having stolen bikes hidden in the family shed and was twiceacquitted. The first case only came to court after the owner of one of the stolen bikes tracked down Emwazi, who had put it up for sale on Ebay. The victim contacted him posing as a prospective buyer to get his details which he then passed on to the police. Emwazi faced five charges of possession of criminal property on or before September 29 2010, 'knowing or suspecting it to represent the proceeds of criminal property.' Emwazi's former home (pictured) was on the Mozart estate in west London known for its postcode gang . Emwazi, who was 22 at the time, claimed he had bought the bikes from the GumTree website and was selling them on at a profit. The judge directed the jury to find Emwazi not guilty after a two day trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court in June 2011. Emwazi faced a second trial at Southwark Crown Court a few months later in December 2011 for a similar case where he was also acquitted. Omar, five years his junior, pleaded guilty to possession of stolen goods - bikes - at Isleworth Crown Court in West London in August 2012. Emwazi family in England are now in hiding while father in living in his native Kuwait, from where he has questioned whether his son Mohammed is the killer in the Jihadi John films. It was reported today that Emwazi - who was known to the security services after being accused of trying to get into Somalia - slipped out of Britain by hiding in the back of a lorry before crossing Europe to get to Syria. The BBC has defended its coverage of the unmasking of Jihadi John as Mohammed Emwazi after viewers accused them of glamorising his cause. Emwazi was named last week and details about his family life and education in west London were uncovered by journalists. On the day his identity emerged, the BBC broadcast live from a press conference by prisoner's rights group Cage for 52 minutes. At the press conference, the group's leader Asim Qureshi called the masked killer 'a beautiful young man' and blamed security services for his actions. A BBC journalist gives a live update from outside the home of Mohammed Emwazi last week. The corporation has defended itself against claims it 'glamorised' the ISIS killer . The BBC said it had received 'some complaints from viewers and listeners who feel there has been too much coverage' of the story. But a corporation spokesman said the story was 'globally significant' and the identification of Emwazi was 'an important development'. He said: 'We have a responsibility to report the story as well as examine Emwazi's background and shed light on his radicalisation.

{"question": "Alan Stubbs has lambasted Willie Collum over the referee’s role in the goal that sealed a 2-0 win for Rangers at Easter Road. The Hibernian boss was astonished that Collum didn’t award a free-kick after Lee Wallace appeared to foul Paul Hanlon as the centre-half sought to clear. Kenny Miller seized the loose ball and, with the home defence still appealing for an infringement, cracked home an 80th-minute shot that added to Wallace’s opener. Hibernian manager Alan Stubbs speaks to the fourth official; he was unhappy with the referee's performance . Referee Willie Collum was on the end of some stick from Hibs boss Stubbs after their game against Rangers . Stubbs attempted to pick his words carefully afterwards but couldn’t disguise his anger towards Collum, who has been at the centre of numerous controversies this season. ‘Can I say no comment in case I get into any trouble?’ Stubbs opened. ‘I’ve been in management a short time. I was a player a long time. Over the years, that decision would be given 100 per cent of the time. ‘I think that’s probably the best way to describe it without me getting into trouble. ‘Not 90 per cent, not 99 per cent, 100 per cent. But a guy who has an influence over a game decided differently. Stubbs was sure that a foul on Paul Hanlon (right) would have been given '100 per cent' of the time . Stubbs (centre) watches on from the dugout as his Hibs side fell to a 2-0 defeat by Rangers . ‘When he sees it back again... well, there’s no point. He’s there to get the big calls right and he got a big call very, very wrong. ‘There was no point speaking to him afterwards. Everyone in the stadium could see it was a foul. ‘I don’t want to sit here and try to justify a decision. Only one guy can do that, but he’s protected and not allowed to talk. It spoiled the game, although obviously not from Rangers’ point of view.’ Hanlon was booked for his protests towards Collum as Rangers celebrated Miller’ s first goal since December. ‘Most of the stadium felt it was a foul,’ said the defender. ‘I thought it was but the referee thought differently. Kenny Miller (centre) celebrates after his goal gave Rangers an unassailable 2-0 lead over Hibs . Miller is mobbed by the ecstatic Rangers supporters who had made the trip to Easter Road on Saturday . ‘I read the pass, got in front of Wallace and went to clear with my right foot. I just felt like I was taken out. ‘It’s disappointing a decision like that has maybe ruined our chances of getting anything from the game. ‘I wasn’t given an explanation, he (Collum) just decided to book me for dissent even though I didn’t say much. ‘I just said it was a foul, along with everyone else who surrounded him. ‘I didn’t even think I was in his face but I think he just has to pick a player and book him.’", "answer": ["Lee Wallace and Kenny Miller scored as Rangers beat Hibernian 2-0 .\nThat result leaves Rangers three points behind Hibs with a game in hand .\nHibs boss Alan Stubbs was unhappy with the referee's performance .\nHe was astonished Collum didn't award Hibs a free-kick in the build-up ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "Stores are set to cut back on Black Friday discounts this year to avoid another ‘delivery tsunami’. The idea of Black Friday has been imported from America, where retailers offer big discounts to kick start the Christmas shopping season. However, it proved a disaster in Britain last year with long queues and violent scenes which saw the police criticising supermarkets for failing to put in place proper security. The web stores trade body, IMRG, has warned retailers that they will have to fundamentally rethink how they handle Black Friday this year after a catastrophe in 2014 . At the same time, many online stores were simply unable to cope with the rush of orders with the result that a huge delivery backlog was created. Many retailers were also disappointed to find the event merely brought forward sales that would have happened later in December, rather than generating any extra business. The web stores trade body, IMRG, has warned retailers that they will have to fundamentally rethink how they handle Black Friday this year. Significantly, it said: ‘Black Friday can be very profitable for retailers who get it right, but discount rates will need to be rationalised and panic-discounting avoided.’ It suggests stores might want to spread the discounts and promotion over a longer period, perhaps a weekend or week, in order to avoid the spike in orders. Firms should also ensure they have sufficient couriers to cope and warn customers that deliveries may take longer than normal, or set up alternative click and collect services. Scenes of violence: Cutomers fought tooth and nail to make the most of discount deals on black Friday. The scale of the event greatly exceeded everyone’s expectations . For many the scenes of chaos didn't pay off. Some retailers were disappointed to find the event merely brought forward sales that would have happened later in December, rather than generating any extra business . The IMRG said: ‘The scale of Black Friday 2014 greatly exceeded everyone’s expectations, which meant a large number of online orders were compressed into a far shorter period of time than anticipated – triggering an online retail ‘delivery tsunami’. ‘This heavily impacted carrier and retailer fulfilment operations and normal activity suffered for days afterwards.’ Andrew Starkey, head of e-logistics at IMRG, said: ‘The huge surge in demand on Black Friday 2014 was unprecedented and caught everyone in the industry by surprise. Fevered and bullish behaviour in retail outlets saw the police criticising supermarkets for failing to put in place proper security . ‘The exact form of it may evolve in 2015, but at least this time we have a precedent and time to develop strategies to ensure the Christmas peak runs as efficiently as possible. ‘It’s fair to say that Black Friday splits opinion, but the impact of it is so vast that it affects all retailers whether they run campaigns or not. ‘The key points for industry to address are around how to smooth out the spike – even spreading it over a few days would make a massive difference to fulfilment operations – and managing expectation so that customers receive accurate and up-to-date information about the progress of their orders.’ Firms should also ensure they have sufficient couriers to cope and warn customers that deliveries may take longer than normal, or set up alternative click and collect services, the IMRG said.", "answer": ["Shops cut back US retail event to avoid deliveries overload and confusion .\nDiscounts supposed to kick-off Christmas proved disaster in the UK .\nScenes of violence and disappointment marred Britain's Black Friday .\nRush to order reduced merchandise online created huge delivery backlog .\nExpectations must be managed and crowds tamed for success this year ."], "label": "SUM"}

Hamilton's world championship defence got off to a flying start on Sunday with a crushing victory for Mercedes in the season-opening Melbourne race as F1 rivals succumbed to a farcical rash of reliability problems. Pole-sitter Hamilton started from a grid reduced to 15 cars from a possible 20 and cruised to his 34th race win with a 1.3sec gap to runner-up team-mate Nico Rosberg. Lewis Hamilton celebrates his Australian GP win in front of second-placed Nico Rosberg and Sebastian Vettel . Hamilton stormed to victory at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix following a dominant performance . Nico Rosberg followed Hamilton home as Mercedes picked up where they left off with total domination . By the time fans were heading out of Albert Park, Red Bull consultant Helmut Marko was discussing the possibility of billionaire owner Dietrich Mateschitz falling out of love with the sport and leaving. Appearing on an afternoon TV show in Sydney on Tuesday, Hamilton agreed that Mercedes' dominance had caused controversy and responded to suggestions of a possible Red Bull withdrawal by saying all the other teams could do better.

'There's a lot of potential, particularly in the rules for them to make big steps and close the gap. So we still have a fight on our hands,' said Hamilton. There have been suggestions that F1 is too technical and complicated. but Hamilton did not agree. 'It's not for us...So you've got to hire some better people I guess. Ultimately it's a test and a challenge of evolution, of innovation and we've hired great people to - and we've done a great job and we weren't complaining when they were doing.'

{"question": "A man from the NSW Hunter region who killed a litter of puppies by smashing them over the head with a rock has been slapped with an extra nine animal cruelty charges. It comes amidst news that the sole pup to survive the attack, nicknamed 'Lucky', is 'stable'. Earlier this month an advertisement was posted on website Gumtree selling a litter of bull terrier puppies. When the 11 pups failed to sell in a week, the seller offered them for free, police said at the time. Scroll down for video . The only pup to have survived the attack on a litter of bull terriers near New Castle last month -nicknamed 'Lucky' is doing well in RSPCA care . Police allege Nathan Thompson, 25, collected the animals on March 11 and took them to bushland at Kurri Kurri, near Newcastle. It's alleged that a witness saw the 25-year-old man begin to kill a number of the puppies, aged six to eight weeks, by hitting them over the head with a rock before throwing them into the bush. The witness confronted the man, who drove away from the area. An RSPCA inspector was called to the bushland and found five dead pups and another two still clinging to life. Nathan Thompson (pictured) pleaded guilty to nine extra animal cruelty charges in court on Thursday . 'There were seven pups in total when we arrived and five of them were deceased,' David O'Shannessy, RSPCA NSW's chief inspector, told Daily Mail Australia. 'Most of them had significant head injuries so you can image what the scene was like when we got there. 'The inspectors quickly transported the surviving dogs to the clinic but one of them died on the way.' The only pup to survive the ordeal has since been named 'Lucky' and is being cared for by the RSPCA, who last week confirmed she was doing well. 'There are rumours flying around about Lucky, the sole survivor of the horrible animal cruelty case in Kurri Kurri last week, that she isn't doing well. We are happy to quell these rumours and let you know that she is still stable and under close veterinary surveillance,' the RSPCA wrote on their Facebook page. He allegedly loaded 11 Bull Terriers in his car and took them to bushland at McLeods Road, Kurri Kurri - north of Sydney - on Wednesday afternoon. Only one of the animals survived (pictured) 'Her condition has not deteriorated. If her condition does change, we will let the community know.' Thompson fronted court earlier this month and pleaded guilty to three animal cruelty charges and resisting arrest. On Thursday he pleaded guilty to another nine animal cruelty offences.

{"question": "(CNN)Is Philae still alive? The answer to this particular cosmic cliff-hanger was left unresolved towards the end of last year. The tiny space probe bounced across the surface of Comet 67P before touching down away from its intended landing zone. It returned plenty of data from the surface but ended up in a shady spot where there wasn't enough sunlight to keep it powered -- so then it went to sleep and nothing has been heard since November. In the months since, mission scientists have not been able to pinpoint its exact resting place. But now the comet-chasing mother ship Rosetta -- in orbit around 67P -- is to begin listening for signs that the lander has survived the cold and dark. Scientists at the European Space Agency (ESA), which is leading a consortium that includes NASA to find out more about the composition of comets and how they interact with the Sun, believe that if enough sunlight falls on Philae's solar panels it could revive. As the comet gets closer to the Sun and more light illuminates the lander, the chances improve. Lander system engineer Laurence O'Rourke told CNN that Philae needs 5.5 watts of power to reboot itself, nine watts to switch on the receiver to accept communications and 19 watts to activate its transmitter and allow two-way communication with the orbiter. Modern energy-saving domestic light bulbs consume 20 watts or lower so it doesn't need much to re-establish contact. On Tuesday, @ESA_Rosetta tweeted: \"Excited! I have some opportunities to listen for @philae2014 to find out if he's awake!\" Rosetta and Philae's love affair on Twitter . On the Rosetta mission blog, lander project manager Stephan Ulamec says: \"It will probably still be too cold for the lander to wake up, but it is worth trying. The prospects will improve with each passing day.\" The mission website adds that Philae could already have woken up but does not yet have sufficient power to communicate with Rosetta. It says Rosetta will transmit to Philae between March 12 and March 20, listening for a response. Problems began for the lander when devices designed to anchor Philae to the surface failed. The gravity is so weak that without the harpoons intended to fire from the feet, the probe bounced across the comet. However, the mishap could prove to be a happy accident. O'Rourke explained that as the comet nears the Sun, Philae's original landing spot would have exposed it to temperatures that would have burned out its electronics. In that position it most likely would have died by now. From lander pictures, mission controllers think Philae, which is about the size of a washing machine, is tucked up underneath a cliff face, affording it some shade. Beginning Thursday, mission controllers will send what O'Rourke described as \"blind commands\" to Philae in the hope that the lander has enough power to receive instructions even if it can't respond. Philae will be told to save power for the transmitter. O'Rourke admits that it's a \"long shot\" but the team will try again in April if this attempt fails. If Philae revives it could be witness to an amazing show as the comet makes its closest approach to the Sun in August. \"I think we are going to see some amazing images at that point,\" said O'Rourke. Even if Philae never wakes up, all is not lost. The mission has detected organic chemicals on the comet surface, though full details of that discovery have yet to be revealed. And the Rosetta mission is already changing perceptions of comets. O'Rourke says instead of a comet being a dirty snowball he now thinks of it as being \"an icy dirtball.\" He described discoveries of dust and large \"boulders\" circling the comet after they were blown off by the Sun during previous orbits, and an image that appears to show a structure the size of a football pitch that has been lifted and then deposited next to the hole. \"The Rosetta mission is not just about the lander. It's about orbiting and following a comet -- watching it wake up and then go to sleep again, finding the secrets held by comets. Every day is a new discovery,\" he said. Scientists have already applauded the mission's success to date. \"The Rosetta radar experiment will reveal for the first time how a comet is put together,\" cosmochemist Denton S.

{"question": "David Cameron last night agreed to a single TV debate during the election campaign. The Prime Minister is expected to attend a seven-way session at the start of April, to be shown on ITV. The deal includes three other political programmes during the campaign in which some of the party leaders will take questions from the public or television interviewers. Scroll down for video . The Prime Minister has agreed to one seven-way debate hosted by ITV on April 2. He will also appear on a number of election specials – but without going head to head against Ed Miliband . Crucially, the BBC, Sky, ITV and Channel 4 appear to have blinked first and dropped their demand for a head-to-head clash between the PM and Ed Miliband. And they have backed down from their apparent threat to ‘empty chair’ the PM by holding debates with other leaders which he refused to attend. Labour appeared to deny the validity of the new proposal, insisting it still wanted three debates as originally proposed and accusing the PM of ‘running scared’ of a one-to-one with Mr Miliband. But, in an attempt to nail down the latest agreement, Mr Cameron said the other parties should accept it. ‘An offer’s been made, a deal’s been accepted, now the other parties must make clear that they accept this deal too, otherwise they will have to bear the responsibility,’ he said. ‘That’s what happened: a new offer put forward by the broadcasters, led by the BBC, to me, I accepted it, in full, on Saturday. So, I’m helping to make this debate go ahead. The other parties have got to stop running away from this and agree to the debate the broadcasters have now suggested.’ Labour leader Ed Miliband and the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg would only face Mr Cameron in one seven-way debate . The latest proposal is thought to have been presented to the parties over the weekend. According to Tory sources, it includes four potential shows, the first in just nine days’ time on March 26. It will be a Channel 4 and Sky joint production hosted by Jeremy Paxman and featuring the PM and Mr Miliband, one after the other, facing questions from the host and a studio audience. The second show will be the only debate and will involve seven party leaders, with the addition of Nick Clegg, Nigel Farage, Green leader Natalie Bennett, Nicola Sturgeon of the SNP and the Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood. It will be broadcast by ITV on April 2. On April 16 the BBC is proposing a ‘challengers’ debate featuring the Greens, SNP, Ukip and Plaid. A week before polling day, on April 30, the BBC will host a 90-minute Question Time-style show with Mr Cameron, Mr Miliband and Mr Clegg appearing one after the other to face questions from a TV audience. This is a better deal for the Lib Dems, who complained that a head-to-head between the other two leaders would prevent them from defending their record in government. A Labour spokesman said: ‘No one should be fooled: David Cameron is still running scared of a head-to-head televised debate with Ed Miliband.’ n Mr Cameron poked fun at Ed Miliband for posing for TV cameras in a pokey kitchen that turned out to be one of two in his £2.5million London home. ‘I am not saying this to make a point but you shouldn’t pretend to be something you are not,’ the Prime Minister said. Showing off the open-plan kitchen he and wife Samantha had installed in Downing Street, he added: ‘We are lucky, we both work, we were able to spend our own money on this. ‘To me, the kitchen is where you spend all your time.

His best friend Berry Tolson, who met Mr Greener 50 years ago when they both played for the London Latvian Basketball Klub, said he was so tall he could put the ball into the net with no effort. Britain's former tallest man Christopher Greener was buried today in a bespoke coffin measuring almost 8ft long and eight pallbearers were needed to carry him . Mr Greener, who grew to be 7ft 6in and a half inches and weighed up to 30 stone, died last month, aged 71 . 'Chris, as my wife would say was a 'gentle giant', he was very funny, caring and kind and our whole family will miss him terribly. 'He struggled towards the end of his life with his health and found it increasingly difficult to get around. 'Mowing the lawn and day-to-day chores were extremely difficult for him being so extremely tall but he was always cheery and never stopped making us laugh. 'He even joked to Irene, my wife, that he expected getting a coffin to fit him could be difficult and that he wouldn't mind if we just got someone to 'break his legs'. 'My wife and I are thankful to Chris for all of the great memories that he has provided us with and we will never forget the gentle giant that we loved dearly.' The coffin (right) was made specifically for him and at least 10 pallbearers were needed to carry it as he also weighed 30 stone . Mr Greener had to be buried in a double plot of land, which is normally reserved for two people . Mr Greener had to be buried in a double plot of land, which is normally reserved for two people, at his parish church in Hayes, near Bromley, Kent. He was diagnosed at 27 with a condition known as pituitary gigantism where a tumour had grown on his pituitary gland, an organ that controls bodily functions including release of growth hormones. Surgeons removed the tumour when he was already in the record books for being UK's tallest man and he would have continued to grow if they had not. He played basketball internationally for Great Britain in the late 60s and early 70s and played the circus giant in David Lynch's film The Elephant Man. Mr Greener also starred in The Rainbow Thief and Birdie Blues as well as appearing in several documentaries chronicling the lives of the very tall. Mr Greener held the title of Britain's tallest man for four decades and is pictured  in 1996 outside the Market Weighton house once owned by Yorkshire's 7ft 9ins Giant William Bradley and later by Sylvia France (left) Mr Greener lost his title as Britain's tallest man in 2007. The 71-year-old spent the majority of his life towering over friends and family. He is pictured above at a friend's wedding . Fellow actor and friend Ross Sambridge, 7ft 1in tall, met Christopher at the Tall Club which he founded. Ross said 'He was a great guy, a real gent.' Matthew Uden Funeral Director from W.Uden and Sons said: 'I had the pleasure to find out about Christopher after I had a long chat with his friends, they described him as a gentle giant who had an enormous heart. 'The funeral went very well with some beautiful things being said about his life and antics, I am sure that he would have been pleased with his send off. 'Mr Greener was an extremely tall chap and we had 8 coffin bearers to carry him in to the church as opposed to the usual 4 or 6.' Mr Greener's height afforded him roles in films.

Mr Greener was buried at St Mary's Cemetery in Hayes, Bromley, earlier today and his friends described him as a 'gentle giant' Mr Greener towers over his father (left) who is stood on the front step of their home, both pictures talen in the Sixties . He held the title for 40 years and was replaced in 2007 by Neil Fingleton, who measures 7ft 7.56ins tall. Mr Fingleton, from Durham, also played basketball and is now an actor, having recently starred alongside Mila Kunis in Jupiter Ascending. Neither however beat the record of William Bradley, who at 7ft 9ins tall, was known as the Yorkshire Giant until his death in 1820. Last year Leonid Stadnyk, believed to be the world's tallest man at an estimated 8ft 5in tall, was carried to a graveyard on the back of an open truck because his remains were too large for a hearse. Throughout his life Mr Stadnyk, from Ukraine, had refused to be measured to determine his height because he said it would be humiliating. Among the activities Mr Greener was able to take part in was basketball where he shone on the court .

{"question": "More than half of young adults in Los Angeles can fluently speak a language other than English, despite the fact that the city's percentage of foreign born residents is decreasing. Fifty-seven per cent of those aged 18 to 34, in LA spoke a language other than English at home, beating out Miami which had 55 per cent and San Jose with 54 per cent. Roughly a quarter of the 'Millenial' generation nationwide uses another language, according to the American Community Survey. A map of young adults' ability to speak a language other than English uses dark red for counties where more than 40 per cent of 18 to 34-year-olds communicate in a foreign language at home, and lighter shades of pink for smaller proportions of the population . Roughly 60 per cent of LA city residents age five and older speak a language other than English, with Spanish the most popular language among them. In addition to a large number of Latino immigrants, Los Angeles also has large Middle Eastern, Asian, Middle Eastern and Eastern European communities. However, the proportion of foreign-born adults in Los Angeles has actually decreased 9 percentage points to a little less than a third since 1990, and a large number of the Millenials with foreign language skills are thought to be bilingual. The rise in bilingualism is probably caused by children continuing to speak their parents' tongues in addition to English, according to Voice of America. UCLA professor Raul Hinojosa said that the children and grandchildren of immigrants historically stopped learning to speak the same language of their ancestors, but that there has been a 'sea change in the last ten years'. California has seen a growing percentage of its young adults speaking foreign languages (bars in blue) since the 1980s. The US as a whole (pink bars) has also seen its rate increase at a slower pace . Hinojosa said that languages beyond Spanish, second and third-generation immigrants will be encouraged to keep knowledge of Mandarin and other languages. The American Community Survey collected data between 2009 and 2013 and found that 23.3 per cent of the population was between 18 and 34 years old, a fall from 30 per cent in 1980. Data showed that the generation is less likely to be married and more likely to have gone to college than three decades ago, as well as more likely to speak a foreign language. Areas that showed the highest rates for speaking something other than English were near the US-Mexico border in California and Texas. New Jersey was found to be the third most likely state for a young adult to speak a foreign language at home. West Virginia ranked last for the statistic with 3.63 per cent and Middlesborough, Kentucky, was the metro with the lowest percentage of young adults who could speak a foreign language with 0.034. In contrast to Los Angeles, many US cities and states have seen significant increases in their foreign-born populations. The United States as a whole saw its estimated foreign-born population decline 0.4 percentage points from 2000 to the American Community Survey. US: 25 per cent . Atlanta: 22.5 . Boston: 28.1 .

{"question": "Nine-man Cardiff survived a late Brentford onslaught to dent the home side's promotion charge with a smash-and-grab 2-1 win. All the goals came from goalkeeping blunders in a game which ended with Kadeem Harris and Federico Macheda both seeing red for Cardiff. Andre Gray gave the home side a first-half lead, but goals from Macheda and Alex Revell turned things round for Cardiff. Cardiff's Kadeem Harris was sent off for a reckless lunge on Brentford midfielder Alan Judge . The Welsh club came to west London with a game plan to stifle the fluent Bees by breaking the game up at every opportunity, and Brentford at times looked rattled by their physical approach. Yet the Bees took the lead midway through the first half after a howler by their former stopper Simon Moore, who could only parry Alex Pritchard's dipping free-kick into the path of Gray to bundle home from close range. The hosts should have put the game beyond doubt by the break, only an acrobatic Moore save denying Pritchard's deflected looping shot. Jota also caused havoc down the right flank and Gray twice went close to extending the lead before the break. Brentford striker Andre Gray beats Cardiff goalkeeper Simon Moore (left) to score opening goal . However, the Bluebirds upped the physical stakes after the interval and made Brentford pay for a lacklustre display. Macheda drew them level on 53 minutes when Brentford goalkeeper David Button collided with his own centre-back Harlee Dean and dropped the ball into the path of the Italian, who slid home from 12 yards. And the comeback was complete on 68 minutes when Button raced off his line to intercept a hopeful through ball and was caught in no man's land for Revell to chip home into the empty goal. However, the sheen was taken off the win by two red cards for the Welshmen. Alex Revell (left) celebrates scoring Cardiff's winner with Federico Macheda . Harris, on loan at Griffin Park last season, was the first to go on 78 minutes, having come on as a half-time sub, for a reckless lunge on Bees midfielder Alan Judge. And former Manchester United striker Macheda followed him to the dressing room with minutes remaining for a second yellow card. That sparked a frantic spell of pressure from Brentford which saw James Tarkoswski head over when well placed and Tommy Smith's goal-bound drive blocked by a melee of City bodies as Russell Slade's men held on. Cardiff almost snatched a third deep into stoppage time, but Kenwyne Jones squandered a gilt-edged chance to give the scoreline a flattering feel by blazing over after racing on to a through ball with the home defence committed. CHARLTON 1-3 BLACKBURN . A clinical double from Blackburn striker Jordan Rhodes ensured victory against lacklustre Charlton. It was Blackburn’s third win of the season over Charlton, having already beaten them 2-0 in the reverse fixture and 2-1 in the FA Cup at the Valley. Blackburn keeper Jason Steele takes out Charlton Athletic's Igor Vetokele and gives away a penalty . Alex Baptiste of Blackburn and Igor Vetokele chase after the ball . Gary Bowyer’s side have now lost only one of their last nine games in all competitions, and the win keeps alive slim play-off hopes. Craig Conway was also on target for Blackburn, while Yoni Buyens pulled one back from the spot. Bowyer was delighted with Scottish international Rhodes, and said: ‘I thought his two goals were outstanding quality. The second one is a great piece of poaching and a sublime finish, and the first one is an unbelievable finish from a great bit of quick play from us.’ LEEDS 0-0 NOTTINGHAM FOREST . Dougie Freedman was happy to go home with a draw after Nottingham Forest’s stalemate at Leeds. Forest had won six of their first eight games under the Scot to raise hopes of a late run to the play-offs. There was no denying Forest had the better moments as Chris Burke and Ben Osborn drew smart saves from Leeds keeper Marco Silvestri, but they could not get past the Italian and headed back down the M1 with a point. Freedman said: ‘I’m happy with a point. Because of the run we’re on and the standards we’ve set, we expect to win games. ‘We have to be realistic and to come to Leeds and get a point is a good result. We were the better team, and we had better chances.’ ROTHERHAM 1-2 WIGAN . Wigan kept survival hopes alive as two free-kicks from Jermaine Pennant helped close the gap on Rotherham. The win was Malky Mackay’s side’s fourth straight away victory, and gives them a glimmer of hope ahead of the end-of-season run in. Mackay said: ‘Jermaine’s delivery on both was sensational. It’s not until you look at it again that you see exactly what he did, and how he has executed them.’ Matt Derbyshire pulled one back, but it was not enough to save Rotherham. BIRMINGHAM 1-1 HUDDERSFIELD . Joe Lolley, a product of Birmingham’s academy, returned to St Andrew’s to earn Huddersfield a rare away point with a vital equaliser. Huddersfield Town's Joe Lolley (far right) scores the equaliser against Birmingham . Making only his third start since being signed from Kidderminster for £300,000 a year ago, the 22-year-old justified manager Chris Powell’s decision to play him against his former club when he cancelled out David Cotterill’s opener. Powell said: ‘Joe is a real natural talent, but I would like to see the day when he can last 90 minutes. ‘We are just trying to cajole him. We are trying to get that talent shown regularly out on the pitch.’ SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY 1-1 FULHAM . Stuart Gray felt his Sheffield Wednesday side should have been given a free-kick for diving in the build-up to Fulham’s equaliser. Fulham striker Matt Smith is surrounded by Sheffield Wednesday players . Fulham midfielder Ryan Tunnicliffe went down in the Wednesday area before poking the ball to goalscorer Matt Smith in the 75th minute. The goal cancelled out a header from Wednesday substitute Stevie May. Gray said: ‘I think the referee shouted play-on because he presumed the lad had dived. That’s what the lads are saying, so if he thought he dived you would have thought he’d have pulled up and given us a free-kick. You’re taught as a kid to play until the whistle goes, and we did seem to stop.’ BOLTON 2-0 MILLWALL . Neil Lennon described Adam Le Fondre as a ‘priceless commodity’ after watching his on-loan striker shoot down Millwall. Bolton's Paddy McCarthy (left) challenges Lee Gregory of Millwall . Le Fondre now has five goals in 10 games since his arrival from Cardiff, and Bolton boss Lennon said: ‘They were two great finishes, and he is our joint second top-scorer and he has only been in the building since late January. ‘It is a priceless commodity being a goalscorer, and he has done that his whole career.’ New Millwall manager Neil Harris admitted: ‘We are in a difficult position, and there are no promises from anyone in the dressing room as to what we are going to do.’ BRIGHTON 1-1 WOLVES . A late goal from Rajiv van La Parra rescued a point for play-off chasers Wolves. Spanish defender Bruno Saltor raised hopes of a fourth successive home win for Brighton, but Wolves hit back to equalise four minutes later when Van La Parra’s cross went in off David Stockdale. The Brighton keeper then produced a brilliant late save to deny Bakary Sako, and Wolves manager Kenny Jackett said: ‘It was a close game, and a fantastic save at the end to deny us. ‘We have to keep pushing.

We would have loved three points, but thin dividing lines decide games. ‘A number of clubs are looking for promotion, and it is still open for us.’", "answer": ["Cardiff survived a late onslaught to win 2-1 at promotion chasing Brentford .\nJordan Rhodes scored twice as Blackburn claimed 3-1 win at Charlton .\nResurgent Nottingham Forest played out a goalless draw at Leeds ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "Bump on the head or not, Fernando Alonso is the same wily maverick he always was. This most brilliant yet political of drivers, who is apt to spell the word team with the pronoun ‘I’, delivered his disloyal lines here yesterday quietly, courteously and devastatingly. A steering problem, he told a press conference before Sunday’s Malaysian Grand Prix, was the cause of the McLaren driver’s apparently innocuous accident during pre-season testing in Barcelona last month. Just one thing: McLaren repeatedly said there was nothing wrong with their car. Calling on every conceivable bit of tele-metry, they compiled a 37-page report, which they presented to the FIA, substantiating that view. Fernando Alonso stands in front of the world's press as he poses for the cameras ahead of Sunday's race . The Spaniard is back in action this weekend after missing the season-opening Australian Grand Prix . Alonso has claimed his steering wheel locked which caused his pre-season testing crash in Barcelona . ‘The steering problem came in the middle of turn three,’ elaborated Alonso, who missed the opening race in Melbourne as he recovered from the crash that threatened his career. ‘It locked into the right and when I approached the wall I braked at the last moment, I downshifted from fifth to third, and unfortunately we are still missing some data.’ How routine steering data would not be readily available baffled most observers, including a host of former drivers. ‘I’ve listened to Alonso’s very clear explanation of the incident,’ said broadcaster Martin Brundle, who drove in 158 grands prix. ‘Now I’m really confused.’ One of the FIA’s most senior technical officials commended McLaren’s report as honest and robust. Why, then, would the Spaniard blame a steering problem when there is apparently no supporting evidence? Alonso is set for his second McLaren debut after he left the team at the end of the 2007 campaign . The Spaniard was in good spirits as he addressed the media in Sepang after being declared fit to race . The two most obvious reasons are that he was either too proud to admit he made an error, or a possible neurological glitch caused him to black out prior to hitting the wall (even though he was changing gears, he may have been semi-conscious as he did so). It appears he did not mention any steering problem to McLaren until last week - three weeks after the accident. They then smuggled a quotation from him citing this explanation into the middle of a press release on Monday, perhaps to appease him. What they did not expect was Alonso to make such a fuss about the issue when he spoke in the Sepang paddock. That left McLaren snookered. They could not disregard their meticulous data, nor could they publicly argue with their £25million-a-year driver - relations between the team and Alonso still have not entirely recovered from the fractious year he spent at McLaren in 2007. Alonso barely speaks to Ron Dennis, the McLaren chairman. His relationship with the de facto team principal Eric Boullier, who was not at McLaren during Alonso’s first spell there, is somewhat more trusting but he is closer to Andrea Stella, an Italian who moved with him from Ferrari to remain his race engineer. These scenes echoed 2007, when Alonso threatened to report incriminating evidence about Dennis to the FIA during the Spygate scandal. Alonso arrives in the Sepang paddock for the Malaysian Grand Prix; the second round of the championship . The double world champion in the paddock with compatriot Carlos Sainz prior to Thursday's media briefing . Back then, the team were split in two. Alonso and his manager Luis Garcia Abad would brief Spanish journalists in one corner. The same procedure happened at the team’s hospitality area here on Thursday. Alonso was again surrounded by his cabal - Abad and his deputy Alberto Fernandez, and physiotherapist Edoardo Bendinelli - as he ate jacket potatoes as part of the so-called ‘boys’ lunch’ ... the meal provided for the team’s mechanics and engineers. By this point, Alonso, who arrived at the track at 9.45am, had been cleared by the FIA’s doctors to compete on Sunday, a virtual formality after he passed more extensive tests by three Cambridge University doctors at the weekend. Yet still the mystery goes on. Alonso said he was ‘perfectly conscious at the time’ of the accident - a version of events that seems to contradicts with McLaren’s public statements and eyewitness accounts at the scene. Alonso insisted he will have no problems stepping back into the cockpit for first practice on Friday . Alonso smiles in his car in the garage at Sepang, home of this weekend's Malaysian Grand Prix . ‘I lost consciousness in the ambulance or in the clinic at the circuit but the doctors said this is normal because of the medication they gave me for the helicopter transfer and the checks they did in hospital,’ he said. ‘There is a time I don’t remember from two o’clock to six o’clock, but that was normal on the medication.’ Alonso more plausibly denied reports originating in Spain that he woke up believing himself to be a teenage go-karter. He said he could remember everything the following day, but then said it took him ‘three or four days’ to gather his memory. Baffling. But not for his team-mate Jenson Button, who said: ‘I’ve seen every single bit of data many times. Nothing has changed. It all says that the car is OK.’ It was Button’s polite way of saying what we were all thinking about the confused nature of Alonso’s testimony.", "answer": ["Fernando Alonso has spoken out for first time since crash in Barcelona .\nHe sustained concussion and was ruled out of season opener in Australia .\nBut Spaniard has been declared fit for this weekend's race in Malaysia .\nAlonso claims steering wheel failure caused his pre-season testing crash .\nAnd he denied reports in Spanish media he 'woke up in 1995'"], "label": "SUM"}

Soldiers escort a man who authorities identified as Omar Trevino Morales, whose aliases include 'Omar,' '42' and 'Commandante 42' The suspect is the brother of Miguel Angel Trevino Morales, described as the most bloodthirsty leader of Mexico's most violent organized crime group. Miguel Angel was arrested in July 2013, almost a year after marines killed the Zetas' other biggest leader, Heriberto Lazcano 'El Lazca.' ‘Omar Trevino was the heir to all the Zetas who were going down,’ said Raul Benitez, a security expert at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. The Zetas carved a path of brutality, bloodshed and mutilated bodies across northern Mexico during their turf battles with the rival Gulf cartel, claiming upwards of 100,000 lives since 2007.

Once the flashpoint for the worst of the violence, security in northern Mexico has improved considerably, except for the lawless northeastern border state of Tamaulipas, said Raul Benitez. Founded in the late 1990s by deserters from an elite Mexican army unit, the Zetas initially acted as enforcers for the powerful Gulf cartel, based along the border with Texas and one of the oldest criminal syndicates in Mexico. But the group struck out on its own in early 2010, setting off the most violent phase in Mexico's drug war.

{"question": "Stuart McCall insisted Rangers had earned a vital psychological boost in the battle to follow Hearts into the Premiership after recording a breakthrough 2-0 win over Hibs. The Ibrox outfit had lost all three previous Championship meetings with Alan Stubbs’ men by a crushing 9-1 aggregate scoreline, but turned the tables at Easter Road in a result which also meant the Tynecastle club were officially promoted as second-tier champions. Goals from Lee Wallace and Kenny Miller — the latter strongly disputed by Hibs — gave McCall a first win in charge and hoisted the Rangers to within three points of their second-placed hosts with a game in hand. Stuart McCall celebrates watching his side beat Hibernian 2-0 at Easter Road on Sunday . There is a fair chance the two sides could meet again in the play-offs and McCall admitted it was essential his side stopped the rot against their Leith rivals. ‘First and foremost I would like to congratulate Hearts on an outstanding season and winning the title,’ said the Ibrox boss, who drew his first two matches in charge. ‘Robbie Neilson and his team have been outstanding all season, so fair play to them. ‘I am delighted with our performance and the result but it’s only one game, we won’t get carried away. But it will restore a bit of confidence that has been severely lacking. ‘It’s a stepping stone. But if we are to hopefully get back into the top league at the end of the season then we’re likely going to have to play Hibs in a decider. ‘If we had come here and got beat today then psychologically it wouldn’t have been good, so this will help. But we have a long way to go. ‘We want to go into the play-offs with momentum, with a bit of spirit and confidence and players playing at the level they can play.’ Rangers had drawn their five previous games and travelled to Easter Road on the back of just one win in nine. Lee Wallace (centre) is congratulated by his team-mates after giving Rangers the lead away to Hibernian . Wallace slams home the opener just before half-time to put the away side in control at Easter Road . That dire run had left Ibrox fans despairing about their promotion hopes but McCall, who earned joy from switching to a 3-5-2 shape, feels his team have now shown they are good enough to go up. ‘Yes, that’s all we want from them,’ he said. ‘Whatever is past has now gone — even today has now gone. There are players in there who need a bit of belief and confidence. A performance like today can only help. ‘I said to the players, there is only one thing better than winning and that is winning as an underdog, when people don’t expect it of you. There is a long way to go and we won’t be getting carried away but it helps with the confidence, morale and belief.’ Rangers fans chanted McCall’s name as the minutes ticked away at Easter Road but he played down the formation rejig that drew a radically improved display. ‘Listen I am no master tactician or anything like that,’ he said. ‘We played a shape and it worked but that was down to the players who carried out what we wanted them to do. ‘You can talk about formations and tactics, whatever, but the bottom line is if the players show the desire and the willingness and the ability like they did today, then it’s about players and them doing the jobs they are asked to do. To a man, they did that today.’ Kenny Miller slots home to put the game beyond doubt for Rangers and close the gap on Hibernian .", "answer": ["Rangers closed the gap on Hibs to just three points in the Championship .\nLee Wallace scored the opening goal for Rangers after 44 minutes .\nKenny Miller sealed the tie in the closing minutes with a tidy finish .\nClick here for all the latest Rangers news ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "New Zealand reached their first ever World Cup final as they secured a sensational four-wicket Duckworth/Lewis win over South Africa at a sold out Eden Park on Tuesday. An explosive 49 off 18 balls from South African batsman David Miller saw New Zealand set 298 (D/L) to chase for victory, after a burst of rain reduced the match to 43 overs per side. In response, Brendon McCullum blazed his way to 59 and despite the regular loss of wickets, Grant Elliott smashed the penultimate ball for six to lead New Zealand to a tense victory. Grant Elliott celebrates after smashing the winning runs as New Zealand reached their first ever final . South Africa missed chances in the field, JP Duminy and Ferhaan Berhardian colliding at a crucial moment . Faf du Plessis and Farhaan Behardien cannot believe it after a crucial drop which reprieved Elliott .

Vettori (left) leads his team-mates on a lap of honour to show appreciation for the home fans . Imran Tahir wipes away a tear after South Africa again failed to reach the final of a World Cup . The dejection is clear to see on the faces of the South Africans, after they failed to make it over the line . There was an added spice to the match with neither side having ever previously made it past the semi-finals. New Zealand’s own dismal record of six defeats out of six at this stage of the tournament was a disappointment the native supporters were confident their side would finally overcome in Auckland. But, following their quarter-final victory over Sri Lanka, South African captain AB de Villiers said his side embraced the tag of ‘chokers’ and were striving under the pressure. Having won the toss South Africa chose to bat first and the continued rotation of their side saw Vernon Philander replace the heretofore-impressive Kyle Abbott. With arguably the best attack of the World Cup, New Zealand’s pace bowlers Trent Boult and Tim Southee were successfully swinging the ball and causing the opposition openers all sorts of problems. AB de Villiers falls over the stumps after failing to gather the ball cleanly to run out Corey Anderson . The anguish is clear on De Villiers' face as he let the momentum shift away from South Africa in the semi final . De Villiers has been one of South Africa's stars of the tournament, but his mistake cost his side dear . New Zealand celebrate after taking a wicket during the first innings of their semi-final against South Africa . Du Plessis top-scored for South Africa with 82, as the Proteas scored 281 in a rain-interrupted innings . Corey Anderson, who was expensive but took three of five wickets, celebrates Rilee Roussow's dismissal . David Miller blasted three sixes in his quickfire 49, which boosted the South African score at the end . Somewhat surprisingly the Black Caps’ fielding early on let them down, as first Quinton De Kock was dropped on six by wicketkeeper Luke Ronchi off Boult. Hashim Amla was then put down three balls later on naught at long leg, with Boult the guilty party this time, after he hit a top-edge off Southee. Nonetheless, the tournaments leading wicket-taker redeemed himself in the following over as Boult followed up a bouncer with an in-swinger that took Amla’s (10) inside edge and cannoned into middle stump, with Eden Park erupting in jubilation. Attempting to release the shackles, De Kock (14) shuffled down the wicket to Boult and as he swung hard at a full ball, a thick edge flew to third man and South Africa were reduced to 31 for two after eight overs. Slow starts coupled with explosive finishes have the been framework for many of De Villiers side’s innings during this World Cup and their efforts in Auckland was following the same suit. Required to rebuild, Faf du Plessis and Rillee Rossouw put on an 83-run third-wicket partnership to steady the ship. De Villiers hit another impressive 65, continuing his excellent form, as South Africa accelerated their innings . The South African captain salutes the crowd after reaching yet another half century . However, McCullum brought on Corey Anderson and he sent down a bouncer that hit the shoulder of the Rossouw’s bat and was caught one-handed by Martin Guptill at backwards point to dismiss the left-handed batsman for 39. As De Villier’s came to the crease he was once again required to provide a rescue mission but was almost dismissed on his first delivery as he nearly gloved the ball onto the stumps. But, the right-handed batsman remained un-fazed and in typical style he took the attack to the opposition. Kane Williamson committed the cardinal sin of dropping the South African captain and New Zealand were made to pay as the next three balls were dispatched to the boundary rope. As Du Plessis and De Villier’s partnership passed the 100-run mark some unscheduled rain arrived to check their progress on 216-3 after 38 overs. It was an interruption that undoubtedly favoured New Zealand, just as South Africa looked like they were ready to explode and by the time the skies cleared the match was reduced to 43 overs per side. Having anchored his sides innings Du Plessis was dismissed for 82 off the second ball after the restart, as he gloved a bouncer from Anderson to Ronchi behind the stumps. For South Africa it turned out to be the perfect catalyst for an exciting end as Miller entered and smashed six fours and three sixes in his quick-fire 49. With 65 runs hit off their final five overs after the delay the Proteas posted 281-5, setting New Zealand a challenging 298 (D/L) to win. Brendon McCullum flicks the ball away as he got New Zealand off to a blistering start in their chase . McCullum's combination of clever shotmaking and explosive power set New Zealand up for a win . Morne Morkel hit back for South Africa, dismissing McCullum and Kane Williamson in quick succession . McCullum, who has become known for thriving on leading from the front, signaled his intent in the first over of his sides innings as he sent a short Dale Steyn delivery over extra cover for a maximum. Although Guptill - fresh from hitting a record 237 against the West Indies in fourth quarter-final - was looking uncomfortable, his captain was in full flow at the other end and reached his half-century off just 22 balls. South Africa’s pace bowlers were bleeding runs so De Villiers turned to his energetic spinner Imran Tahir and a tight first over applied a bit of pressure on the batsmen. And, McCullum (59) succumbed attempting to resume clearing the ropes in the next over as he came dancing down the wicket to Morne Morkel and having failed to connect properly could only pick out Steyn at mid-on. Williamson then lasted just 11 balls before he bottom-edged a short Morkel delivery and shattered his stumps on six. New Zealand were faltering and Ross Taylor was guilty for calling for a single and selling Guptill short as he found himself run-out for a scratchy 34. Quinton de Kock runs out Martin Guptill after a mix-up with Ross Taylor as the hosts faltered in Auckland . Duminy (left) celebrates with Du Plessis as South Africa appeared to take control of the contest . Taylor was caught behind for 30, as New Zealand struggled to keep up with the rate . It was fifth bowler JP Duminy who then provided the next crucial breakthrough for South Africa as Taylor was brilliantly caught behind by De Kock for a run-a-ball 30. The match continued to ebb and flow with neither side taking full control of the game before the game changing moment occurred in the 32nd over. As Elliott pushed the ball to point, Anderson called for a run and as he was sent back De Villiers missed a golden opportunity to run-out the stranded batsmen, hitting the stumps with his hand instead of the ball. A superb 103-run fifth-wicket partnership between Elliott and Anderson looked to have taken New Zealand to the brink of victory. However, Anderson skied a Morkel delivery to Du Plessis at square-leg for 58 and Ronchi holed-out in the deep for eight as the tension out in the middle and in the stands stepped up another notch. Anderson (above) and Elliot settled the hosts' nerves with a brilliant partnership of 103 . Anderson punished De Villiers for his missed run out as the game hurtled towards a tense climax . With New Zealand 273-6 and requiring another 26 runs off 16 balls, South Africa missed another crucial run-out opportunity, Elliott this time the lucky survivor. The 36-year-old right-handed batsmen sent a length Morkel delivery high into the evening Auckland sky but the ball fell agonizingly between two Proteas players. Morkel’s final delivery was again pulled high into the air by Elliott but just as Farhaan Behardien looked set to catch it Duminy ran across him as the ball dropped to the ground. Steyn, battling injury, was brought on for the final over with New Zealand requiring 12. And Eden Park erupted in euphoria as Elliott (84 not out) hit the penultimate ball for a maximum as the South African players collapsed to the ground in despair. There is an undeniably belief within the crowd that their side has one more victory in them that will bring New Zealand their elusive first World Cup title. Du Plessis keeps his cool to take a vital catch and dismiss Anderson, setting up a thrilling finish . Du Plessis cannot hide his jubilation as the semi-final came right down to the wire in Auckland .

Jonty Hurwitz's creations are so tiny they can rest on a human hair and are the same size of an ant's head.

But within minutes his work had been destroyed by the stroke of the lab technician's finger. Scroll down for video . The world's smallest sculpture (seen in the eye of a needle, above) was accidentally destroyed by a photographer hired to help its creator capture it in pictures . The artwork, seen here on a human hair, was produced using 3D printing technolog by Jonty Hurwitz . 'I went off to have the original sculptures photographed so I found a laboratory with an electron microscope and the photographic technology,' said Mr Hurwitz. 'The technician went to change the orientation and then for the next half an hour we were looking for the piece through the lens. 'Eventually I noticed there was a fingerprint exactly where the sculpture used to be and I was like \"man you have just destroyed the smallest art pieces\" ever made - I slightly freaked out.' The sculptures are less than 1mm tall and are produced via a process called nano-painting. They are too small to be seen with the naked eye so must be viewed and photographed under a microscope. Mr Hurwitz uses a 3D printing technology to produce them. Describing the process on his website, he said: 'The structure is created using a ground-breaking new 3D printing technology and a technique called Multiphoton Lithography. Mr Hurwitz has produced a number of nano sculptures using the same technology though the naked woman above is believed to have been the smallest . The artist from Chichester, West Sussex, described his work as a combination of 'art and Quantum Physics' 'Ultimately these works are created using the physical phenomenon of two photon absorption. Art, literally created with Quantum Physics. 'This two photon absorption occurs only at the tiny focal point - basically a tiny 3D pixel (called a Voxel).

Bian was on his way back from Singapore after working on a construction site to earn money to pay for his dentist's license. His boss decided it was cheaper to fly through Malaysia. He boarded the Beijing-bound Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 flight in Kuala Lumpur on March 8 last year when it disappeared barely an hour into its journey. No trace has ever been found despite an extensive search. But his mother is convinced he's coming back. \"If it is one year, if it is two years or three, I am looking forward to his return.

I saw them every day for a month as they grappled with confusion and mixed messages from Malaysia Airlines and the Malaysian government. I was there when many received text messages saying \"none of those on board survived.\" Many had to be wheeled out on gurneys. Some lashed out at the cameras. The news cycle moved on but the families are still here. They are still in pain. And all the family members I speak to say their loved ones are alive. They never speak in the past tense, they cling onto each theory that is circulated and they refuse to sign any documents to start financial settlements. \"I think psychologically it is understandable, they choose to believe that their loved ones are still missing, so they can still have hope for them to return,\" says May Lam, a psychiatrist at The University of Hong Kong. She says the families need constant support from social workers and the government and they need to be helped to gradually accept their loss. But many say they are treated like an inconvenience. Families complain of harassment by local communist party officials, several have been detained by Chinese police for holding meetings and some say they have been barred from speaking to the international media. Both the Chinese and Malaysian governments maintain they are doing everything they can to help. Meanwhile, Bian Liangjing's family, like all the others I have met, is stuck in a vortex of grief.

{"question": "Dick Advocaat’s appointment as Sunderland boss seemed complete on Monday night after he told Dutch TV that he had signed a contract until the end of the season. The 67-year-old will sign a short-term deal until the end of the season and his package will be incentivised with the target of survival. Advocaat told Voetbal International: 'I am now in a dark hotel, but soon I'll be working in the Stadium of Light.' Dick Advocaat, pictured here in charge of PSV Eindhoven in 2012, is set to take charge at Sunderland . Gus Poyet has been sacked by Sunderland with the club just one point above the relegation zone . Sunderland supporters turned on manager Poyet after their side were thrashed 4-0 by Aston Villa . 525 - Poyet's number of days in charge since his arrival on October 8, 2013. 75 - The Uruguayan's number of games in charge, winning 23, losing 22 and drawing 30. 3 - The number of games against bitter rivals Newcastle. He won them all with an aggregate of 6-1. 35 - Poyet was the 35th man to manage Sunderland either permanently or as a caretaker. 22 - The number of years between Sunderland's appearances in a major final. Poyet took them to the 2014 Capital One Cup final, 22 years on from their defeat to Liverpool in the FA Cup showpiece. They lost to Manchester City. 14 - Sunderland's final position in Poyet's first season. 4 - The amount of games won in the Premier League by Sunderland this season. The joint-worst with bottom side Leicester. Advocaat could land up to £500,000 if the Black Cats – currently one point above the relegation zone – avoid the drop. He will bring with him Montenegrin coach Zeljko Petrovic, who was Avram Grant's assistant at West Ham in 2010. It is unlikely, however, that Advocaat will be considered as the permanent successor to Gus Poyet, who was sacked yesterday after 17 months at the Stadium of Light. Sportsmail understands that West Ham manager Sam Allardyce and Real Madrid assistant Paul Clement are at the top of the club's shortlist to take charge beyond this season. Clement, in particular, fits the profile of coach who could work within the structure at the club, where sporting director Lee Congerton has control over transfers. Clement and Congerton know each other from their time at Chelsea and the Real No 2 is thought to be keen to try his hand as a manager back in England. Meanwhile, it is Congerton's contacts book which has led to talks with Advocaat. Former Chelsea sporting director Frank Arnesen – who worked with Advocaat at PSV Eindhoven and Congerton at Stamford Bridge and then Hamburg – has recommended him for the role and he will be installed before Saturday's trip to West Ham. Advocaat could land up to £500,000 if the Black Cats –  one point above the drop zone – avoid relegation . 'This is something I always wanted to do, the Premier League. The Premier League is a phenomenal competition,' Advocaat told AD Sportwereld. 'As a manager that is where you want to work, that has such a pulling power. 'Saturday, West Ham awaits. And then there's the international break. And then – the derby with Newcastle United. That is really something to look forward to because believe me, this just is a very big club.' Sunderland owner Ellis Short moved swiftly to dismiss Poyet during a telephone conversation after training on Monday. It is understood the Uruguayan asked for his contract – which expires in 2016 – to be paid up in full after he was informed that his position had become untenable. Zeljko Petrovic, who was Avram Grant's assistant at West Ham in 2010, will work alongside Advocaat . West Ham boss Sam Allardyce could be the long-term successor to Poyet at the Stadium of Light . His assistant Mauricio Taricco and first-team coach Charlie Oatway are also set to leave the club. Former Sunderland favourites and academy coaches Kevin Ball and Paul Bracewell will now be on hand to help at senior level. Short acted on the advice of the influential Congerton and chief executive Margaret Byrne in getting rid of Poyet. They felt there was no way back for the head coach following Saturday's 4-0 defeat at home to Aston Villa. Supporters tried to storm the dugout and also let their feelings be known to those seated in the directors' box. The decision was soon made to dispense with Poyet and contact initiated with Advocaat, who left his post as Serbia national team manager in November after just five months in charge.

{"question": "(CNN)German investigators found antidepressants in the apartment of Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz this week, according to published reports. Die Welt, a German newspaper, cited an unidentified senior investigator who said Lubitz suffered from a severe \"psychosomatic illness\" and German police seized prescription drugs that treat the condition. Lubitz suffered from a \"severe subjective burnout syndrome\" and from severe depression, the source told Die Welt. The New York Times also reported that antidepressants were found during the search of his apartment. CNN has not been able to confirm the reports. Investigators continued to work Saturday to piece together the secret life of Lubitz, who officials say was hiding an illness from his employers. He had been declared \"unfit to work\" by a doctor. They were expected to question his relatives, friends and co-workers as they try to pin down what could have prompted the seemingly competent and stable co-pilot to steer a jetliner into a mountainside on Tuesday. As their efforts continued, dozens of people attended a remembrance ceremony for the victims of the crash at a church in a nearby town, Digne-les-Bains. There were 150 people on board Germanwings Flight 9525, including Lubitz. Relatives of the victims and local residents also gathered Saturday afternoon by a simple stone memorial set up near the crash site, in the village of Le Vernet. Flowers have been laid there, in the shadow of the snow-covered peaks of the French Alps. Much attention has focused on Lubitz's state of mind, with some media reports speculating that he may have had mental health issues. Investigators found a letter in the waste bin of his Dusseldorf, Germany, apartment saying that Lubitz, 27, wasn't fit to do his job, city prosecutor Christoph Kumpa said Friday. The note, Kumpa said, had been \"slashed.\" Just what was ailing Lubitz hasn't been revealed. The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed sources, reported Friday that Lubitz suffered from mental illness and kept his diagnosis concealed from his employer. A subsequent New York Times report on Saturday, citing two officials with knowledge of the investigation, said Lubitz sought treatment before the crash for vision problems that might have put his career at risk. According to those unnamed officials, Lubitz also was being treated for psychological issues. Other media reports indicate he was treated for depression. Lubitz passed his annual pilot recertification medical examination in summer 2014, a German aviation source told CNN. An official with Lufthansa, which owns Germanwings, said the exam only tests physical health, not psychological health, and that if Lubitz had vision problems that would have been discovered during the tests. \"We can't believe it. If anything was wrong with his eyes during the physical exam we would have known,\" the official says. The Lufthansa official also said the company was never given any indication Lubitz was depressed, and that if he went to a doctor on his own  he would have been required to self-report if he had been deemed unfit to fly. A Dusseldorf clinic said he'd gone there twice, most recently on March 10, \"concerning a diagnosis.\" But the University Clinic said it had not treated Lubitz for depression. German investigators said they still have interviews and other work to do before they can reveal what they gleaned from the records found in the apartment and at his parents' home in the town of Montabaur. But the fact that investigators found \"ripped, recent medical leave notes, including for the day of the offense, leads to the preliminary conclusion that the deceased kept his illness secret from his employer and his professional environment,\" prosecutors said. Germanwings corroborated that assertion, saying it had never received a sick note from Lubitz. Authorities left Lubitz's apartment Friday night with boxes of papers and evidence folders after spending about 90 minutes inside. Dusseldorf police said Saturday that a small team of French investigators had arrived in the city and that they were sharing information. Jean Pierre Michel, lead investigator for the French inquiry, told French TV from Dusseldorf that the French team would work in \"full transparency\" with their German counterparts. \"We will interview people related to the investigation in the coming days. The hearings will be conducted in the coming days and weeks,\" he said, according to CNN's French affiliate BFMTV. Asked by a journalist about reports of Lubitz's possible mental illness, he replied: \"The elements of the investigation are strictly confidential and we cannot address these matters today.\" No scenario can yet be ruled out, including mechanical failure, \"as we do not have the necessary evidence,\" he said. The German tabloid newspaper Bild said Saturday it had interviewed an ex-girlfriend of Lubitz. The woman is not named in the story and CNN has not been able to verify the report independently. According to Bild, the ex-girlfriend said Lubitz was a very nice and sensitive man who needed a lot of care and attention, and he was very troubled. She said he would get into fights with her. The newspaper also cited the ex-girlfriend as saying that Lubitz had bad dreams that his plane was going down. Patrick Sondenheimer was the pilot of Germanwings Flight 9525, according to Reiner Sondenheimer of Dusseldorf, Germany, who says he is a relative of Patrick's. Patrick Sondenheimer is the pilot believed to have been locked out of the cockpit by his co-pilot, Lubitz. CNN spoke to Reiner Sondenheimer at his Dusseldorf apartment. Also at the apartment was a woman who did not provide her name but said she was Patrick Sodenheimer's relative. That woman also said that Patrick Sondenheimer was on the doomed flight. Reiner Sondenheimer declined to say anything else, other than the family wanted time to grieve. The pilot has not been named by German authorities. Another Germanwings pilot who once flew with Lubitz, Frank Woiton, told WDR, a local broadcaster belonging to CNN's German affiliate ARD, that his impression of Lubitz was that he was \"friendly\" and that there was \"nothing suspicious.\" Woiton also said Lubitz \"was a good pilot and had a good command of the plane.\" Woiton's first job after he found out about the crash was the route Dusseldorf-Barcelona-Dusseldorf -- the same route as had been taken by Germanwings Flight 9525 a day earlier. He was praised in German media for the emotional announcement he made to passengers before takeoff, in which he said the crew, like everyone else on the plane, wanted to get home safely to their families. At the scene of the crash, two helicopters were being deployed above the mountainside by recovery crews Saturday. The weather has improved after high winds Friday made their complex task even more treacherous. Lt. Col. Xavier Vialenc, a spokesman for the Gendarmerie, told CNN there were about 40 officers at the crash site Saturday. Once at the crash site, recovery workers spend all day working there, he said. Back in Seyne-les-Alpes at the end of the day, they can see a psychologist if they choose and have a debriefing session with all the workers. Vialenc said the operations were going well so far and that the progress made was meeting their expectations. Yves Naffrechoux, captain of rescue operations at Seyne-les-Alpes, told CNN on Friday that rescuers have found bodies at the rugged crash site, but few of them are intact. It could be weeks before all the bodies are recovered, identified and released to the families, authorities said. What could have prompted Lubitz to deliberately destroy the aircraft, killing everyone on board, remains the focus of investigators in Germany. He had passed medical and psychological testing when he was hired in 2013, said Carsten Spohr, CEO of Lufthansa, which owns Germanwings. Spohr also told reporters that Lubitz had \"interrupted\" his pilot training, which he began in 2008. That break lasted several months, he said, but added that such an interruption isn't uncommon. Spohr didn't give a reason for the break. While the ailment Lubitz had sought treatment for hasn't been revealed, that he was declared unfit for work is an important detail, aviation analysts say. Pilots are required to maintain their fitness to fly and must tell their airline if they're found unfit, CNN aviation analyst David Soucie said. Who was co-pilot Andreas Lubitz? Although authorities have recovered the cockpit voice recorder, the flight data recorder remains missing. It could shed crucial details about what happened inside the cockpit, authorities say. Lubitz was the co-pilot on Tuesday's flight between Barcelona, Spain, and Dusseldorf when he apparently locked the captain out of the cockpit, then activated a control causing the plane to descend toward rugged terrain. Germanwings said the plane dropped for about eight minutes from its cruising altitude of 38,000 feet before crashing. The only sounds, authorities said, were those of pounding on the cockpit door, Lubitz's steady breathing and, eventually, screaming passengers. Lubitz and 149 other people on board the plane died in an instant, authorities say. Most were from Germany and Spain. Mother, daughter among 3 American victims .

{"question": "Hometown boy Jimmy Walker held his nerve to close out victory at the Valero Texas Open at TPC San Antonio. The Ryder Cup player added to his Sony Open title this season and three PGA Tour victories in 2014 as a closing 70 maintained his four-shot overnight lead. Jordan Spieth was second on seven under, having perhaps left his run too late before finishing with four birdies in the last five holes. Jimmy Walker poses with the Valero Texas Open trophy after recording a four-shot win . Walker took the trophy at his hometown tournament and now has six wins since the start of 2014 . Walker went into his final round with four-shot lead and managed to preserve his advantage . Walker birdied the par-five second when he laid up short of the green, pitched on and holed a straight eight-foot putt - though he gave the shot back at the fourth. Another bogey at the seventh was off-set as he pitched stone-dead from an awkward bunker stance at the next, and he birdied 10 as well before dropping a shot at 12. Playing partner Spieth made a late bid to exert some pressure with birdies at the 14th - via a 45-foot putt - and 15th and when his tee shot at the showpiece 16th spun back out of the fringe, there was scope for Walker to crack. Instead, the San Antonio resident struck a lovely pin-high tee shot and read the left-to-right break to perfection on the ensuing 16-foot putt. His birdie was matched by Spieth but the four-shot margin remained and despite a poor tee shot, Walker also birdied the penultimate hole with a good putt from 18 feet. Spieth did likewise and both parred the last to leave Walker as the tour's first repeat winner this season. He told NBC: 'It's at home and it's cool, you can feel support of friends, family and fans. It doesn't happen often, to win in your home town. 'It played hard today, sometimes it's hard to make pars. I wasn't putting very good but I finally got the putting stroke smoothed out and holed a couple. 'And Jordan... holy cow! I'll be having nightmares about that guy!' Spieth's efforts mean he has now finished in the top seven in eight of his last 10 starts. Walker, meanwhile, is building momentum for the Masters in two weeks' time and he said: 'I like Augusta. Walker adds the Valero Texas Open to the Sony Open title which he has already won this season . Jordan Spieth finished as runner-up, despite carding four birdies on the last five holes . Spieth said he found it hard to make par at times on the course but was Walker's closest challenger . 'All this keeps adding momentum and confidence and I'm excited to go. I'll head over tomorrow and take another look at it.' Billy Horschel, the third player in the group, finished third outright at four under.

{"question": "Half of the terror attacks carried out or plotted in Britain involve members of just one extremist network, a new report reveals. Al-Muhajiroun, a banned organisation once fronted by hate preacher Anjem Choudary, has been linked to a series of atrocities and plots dating back to 1997. A new book by terrorism expert Raffaello Pantucci has now found that since its formation in the 1980s, the group has been central to Islamic extremism in the UK. More than 20 terror attacks plotted or carried out in the UK - including the 7/7 bombings which killed 52 people - have been linked to extremist network al-Muhajiroun in a new report . It is thought the first known violence directly linked to the group took place in 1997, when a member of the organisation attacked a police officer. At least one of the bombers who carried out London's 7/7 bombings had met a key supporter of al-Muhajiroun, Omar Khyam, before the attacks which killed 52 people on underground trains and a bus in 2005. Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale, who murdered Fusilier Lee Rigby in a street in Woolwich, south-east London in 2013, had both attended events organised by the group. Despite having been banned in 2005, the group has morphed to take on a series of other names, and its influence continues to be felt, with Brustholm Ziamani, who was sentenced last week for plotting an attack inspired by that on Lee Rigby, also having been inspired by al-Muhajiroun. Research shows that out of 51 attacks and plots carried out or foiled in Britain, al-Muhajiroun had influence in at least 23. Mr Pantucci, who studies extremism for defence forum The Royal United Services Institute, said the group sold its followers a radical interpretation of Islam which often inspired them to  commit violence. He told MailOnline: 'It is an oversimplification just to write them off as outcasts or losers, some of them have been involved in quite serious gang activity or crime in the past and end up finding this as a kind of redemption for their activity. 'You also have to remember that some of the top figures are quite charismatic people who are good at drawing people in and given them these very aggressive ideas.' Hate preacher Anjem Choudary (left) was once a leader of the group before it was banned. Supporter Omar Khyam (right) met up with at least one of the London bombers before they carried out the 2005 attack . Al-Muhajiroun was set up by Omar Bakri Mohammed (left), pictured with radical cleric Abu Hamzu (right) Mr Pantucci said that the group's influence had been underestimated in the past and hoped his book - whose title We Love Death As You Love Life is taken from quotation by one of the 7/7 bombers - would encourage politicians to crack down on the organisation and its spin-offs. He added: 'These people are very good at being in the periphery and the background without ever having their hands on the device or being directly implicated in plots, which would see them given heavier sentences. 'I think constant disruption of the group is not a bad thing. By proscribing these groups you force them to change their name, their website, which inhibits them, also by arresting them on more minor charges you take them off the streets for a time.' Al-Muhajiroun was set up by Omar Bakri Mohammed, a Syria-born Islamic extremist who lived in Britain from 1986 until he was banned from returning in 2005 after going to Lebanon. Anjem Choudary, who remains in Britain, later became the public face of the organisation, which re-emerged as groups called Islam4UK and Need4Khalafah after it was banned.

She didn't know at that moment that she had lost her child, but her ability to communicate the events helped save her own life. \"She's an amazing woman to have that will and that drive to survive and do what she did and be able to contact the police and tell us where she was at, where inside of that location she was at, and speak to me as I entered the residence, direct me to her location,\" Sawyer said. \"I mean, she is the only reason why she's alive right now.\" The grisly cutting of the fetus from Wilkins began when she responded to a Craigslist ad about baby clothes for sale. The 26-year-old Wilkins, who was seven months' pregnant, arrived at the seller's home Wednesday in Longmont. Stabbed in the stomach and bleeding, Wilkins called 911. Another officer, Phil Piotrowski, told CNN affiliate KDVR. that the scene was almost too much to bear. He had to take a moment to collect himself. \"When I walked in and looked at her for a short moment, I actually had to walk out for a second because my head wasn't able to wrap around it.\" Still, given what Wilkins had endured, it left him impressed. \"She is probably one of the strongest people I've ever had the pleasure to meet,\" Piotrowski said. Michelle Wilkins' uncle Chris Wilkins said, \"She's alive because professional first responders execute perfectly.\" But Piotrowski believes Wilkins is the one who \"saved her own life.\" The fetus died, but the mother survived and \"is improving minute by minute, hour by hour,\" according to Chris Wilkins. She's reported to be in critical but stable condition. Dynel Lane, 34, a former nurse aide, is being held on $2 million bail while prosecutors weigh charges against her, including murder. Lane is accused of stabbing Wilkins and removing a female fetus. The murder charge would reportedly depend on whether the fetus was old enough to have lived outside of her mother's body. In a statement obtained by KDVR, Michelle Wilkins' family says, \"We cannot begin to fathom the depths of depravity and evil which drove her attacker, and trust that between law enforcement and our legal system; they will make sure justice is carried out.\" CNN's John Fricke contributed to this report.", "answer": ["Officers responding to 911 call found Michelle Wilkins covered in blood .\nWilkins was stabbed and had fetus torn out after she answered a Craigslist ad ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "Labour and David Cameron's Tories remain neck and neck, despite the Conservatives being ahead in the polls . Tomorrow the Queen dissolves Parliament and the Election campaign begins. It will be the strangest Election of modern times and leaves the experts baffled. Most expected that, with economic recovery, and Cameron ahead of Miliband in the polls as favoured Prime Minister, the Tories would pull ahead. That has not happened. Labour and the Tories remain neck and neck. Only a fool, or a social scientist, would predict the outcome. The two major parties now attract a diminishing share of voters – about two in three in 2010 compared with more than 96 per cent in 1951. Voters have a wider choice than ever before. In England, they can opt for three other alternatives – not just the Lib Dems, but also Ukip and the Greens – all of whom score more than five per cent in the polls. In Scotland and Wales, there is a further alternative – the Nationalists. The weakening of the two party system makes a hung Parliament very likely. But, curiously, a small overall majority for the Tories or Labour could prove even more unstable than a hung parliament. The Tories would be at the mercy of their Eurosceptic Right wing, as John Major was in 1992. He had a majority of just 21, and used to say that he was at the mercy of 13 of them who were quite mad. They made his life a misery when he sought to ratify the Maastricht Treaty reforming the European Union. A Labour government with a small majority would be at the mercy of its Left wing which opposes austerity. Labour, contrary to Tory propaganda, is committed not to a splurge in public spending, but to public expenditure cuts, though less severe than Cameron and Osborne are proposing. But Labour austerity would disappoint the expectations of its supporters, many of whom look for rapid improvements in the NHS and social care. Speaking two weeks ago at the London School of Economics, Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader, advised English voters to support the Greens or what she called ‘progressive’ Labour candidates, that is candidates opposed to austerity. She hopes to create an anti-austerity bloc in the next Parliament, composed of the SNP, Greens and Left-wing Labour. That would cause problems for Miliband even if he won a majority. But, obviously, a hung parliament is more likely. The key question is whether it will lead to stable government, as it did in 2010. Many then thought, including myself, that the Conservative/Lib Dem coalition could not last. But it has, and with a comfortable majority of 78 in the Commons it has never really looked in danger of being brought down in Parliament. The danger in 2015 is that no majority coalition can be formed. Under our electoral system, Ukip and the Greens are unlikely to win many seats. That is why both support proportional representation. The SNP, which may well win many seats, will not deal with the Tories and will not join Labour in a coalition. If, as is likely, the Lib Dems lose seats then, even if they were prepared to enter another coalition, that might not be able to secure the 325 seats needed for a majority. This would mean that no two parties – other than the Tories and Labour – could command a majority. We would have a fragmented hung parliament. There would have to be a minority government. The last minority government following a General Election occurred in February 1974 after Ted Heath had gone to the country in the middle of a miners’ strike asking the voters to decide ‘Who Governs?’ The voters, however, refused to give a clear answer and, in the fragmented hung parliament that followed, Labour governed as a minority for seven months. There was then a second General Election in October at which Labour won a small majority. Minority governments do not last long and, being dependent on bargaining with other parties, find it difficult to take long-term decisions. The longest-lasting was between 1929 and 1931, but that was buttressed for part of the time by a pact between Labour and the Liberals. Under our electoral system, Nigel Farage's Ukip and the Greens are unlikely to win many seats . In the past, the Prime Minister could try, as Labour did in 1974, to escape from the minority situation by dissolving Parliament. But the 2011 Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, providing for five-year parliaments, makes that option more difficult. Besides, there is no reason to believe a second General Election would, as in 1974, deliver a majority government. It could easily reproduce the same result. Why have we entered this messy period of multi-party politics, and will it prove more than a temporary condition? I believe it will, because it stems from a new social cleavage in British politics, a cleavage between those who have benefited from globalisation, from social and economic change, and those who have been left behind. The two major parties, together with the Lib Dems, represent the beneficiaries. Their leaders all believe Britain should stay in the EU. They all broadly welcome immigration. They all favour gay marriage. But many voters do not favour these things, and feel unrepresented by the mainstream parties. Alex Salmond (pictured) and Nicola Sturgeon are doing to Labour in Scotland what Nigel Farage is doing to the Tories in England . The typical Ukip supporter is not, as we used to think, Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells, a retired Army officer spluttering over his gin and tonic at the 19th hole, but a working-class voter or small businessman or shopkeeper who feels betrayed and belittled by the system. Blair’s New Labour sought to win over graduates and middle-class professionals – those who aspired to leave the working class. Cameron’s Conservatives sought to distance themselves from the image of the ‘nasty party’ by rejecting Thatcherism and embracing modernisation; while Cameron and Osborne, liberal-minded men, seem remote in lifestyle and understanding from those left behind. Ukip, in consequence, is now the most working-class party in English politics. The SNP in Scotland is different from Ukip in many respects. But it, too, represents the left behind. The vote in the independence referendum last September was a class vote. Labour areas in the west central belt around Glasgow voted ‘Yes’ to independence, while middle-class SNP areas in Perthshire and Aberdeenshire voted ‘No’. West Dunbartonshire, with nearly the lowest life expectancy in Scotland, voted ‘Yes’, East Dunbartonshire, with nearly the highest, voted ‘No’. Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon are doing to Labour in Scotland what Nigel Farage is doing to the Tories in England. The SNP could well be the third-largest party in the next Parliament, even though it will probably secure fewer votes than the Lib Dems, Ukip and the Greens. That will strain the Union to breaking point. In England, Cameron says if you vote for Farage you will get Miliband. In Scotland, Miliband says if you vote SNP, you will get Cameron. But, to the left behind, Cameron and Miliband are equivalent – members of an Oxbridge liberal elite who represent the exam-passing classes who do not understand the aspirations of the less fortunate. That is why the multi-party system is here to stay and why we are about to enter an era of political instability.

{"question": "Former U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. will be released from a federal prison on Thursday and will serve out the remainder of his term in a Washington, D.C., halfway house, former U.S. Rep. Patrick Kennedy told The Associated Press after visiting Jackson behind bars. Kennedy said he spoke with Jackson at the minimum security federal prison camp in Montgomery, Alabama, where the son of the civil rights leader has been serving a 2 ½-year sentence after pleading guilty to illegally spending $750,000 in campaign funds on more than 3,000 personal items. The expenditures included fur capes, lavish interior decorations for his home and rock music memorabilia. Jackson's plea deal was arranged just two days after he was re-elected to represent his Illinois congressional district. At the time Republicans cried foul, noting that they would have had a chance to win hsi seat if news had emerged before Election Day. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Former Illinois Rep Jesse Jackson Jr and his wife, Sandra, were both convicted of federal crimes in a scheme that involved spending mroe than $750,000 of his campaign money on more than 3,000 personal items . BIG HOUSE: Jackson sered his time at the Butner Federal Correctional Complex outside of Raleigh, North Carolina – the same prison where investment fraudster Bernie Madoff is incarcerated . Jackson Jr.'s father, Rev. Jesse Jackson (left) and his wife Jacqueline Lavinia Brown (right) attended court sessions in 2013 and were present for their son's sentencing . Jackson began the sentence on Nov. 1, 2013. The Bureau of Prisons lists his final release date as Sept. 20, 2015. The disgraced lawmaker's crime was officially described as wire and mail fraud, catch-all federal criminal categories frequently used as placeholders for financial corruption. His wife, Sandra, was also sentenced to a year in prison in connection with the corruption scheme. She pleaded guilty to a single charge of filing a false tax return in an attempt to hide the fraud. Court documents showed that Sandra, a Chicago city councilwoman when she was charged, had spent her husband's campaign funds on vacations, electronics and furs. She was ordered to pay $22,000 in restitution, in addition to the $750,000 her husband had to pay back. The U.S. Marshals Service seized all the items purchased illegally and auctioned everything to repay what they stole. Also sold was their richly decorated Washington, D.C. townhouse. The haul included one of the late singer Michael Jackson's fedoras and a guitar reportedly signed by both Michael Jackson and rock star Eddie Van Halen. In an unusual arrangement, a federal judge allowed Mrs. Jackson to avoid reporting to prison until her husband's release so that their children would not lose both parents at once. She will likely begin serving her sentence in September. Jesse Jackson Jr. sold his Washington, D.C. town house (pictured) to help pay a $750,000 forfeiture he owed after his guilty plea . The US Marshals Service auctioned off some of the Jacksons' ill-gotten goods – including these two furs . Kennedy said he was in the area giving a speech on children's mental health and decided to visit Jackson on Monday. 'You can imagine my surprise when I'm there, and I'm talking to him, and he says, \"I'm leaving Thursday morning\",' Kennedy said. He said Jackson, 50, told him he would be picked up from prison by his wife, Sandra; his two children; his father, the Rev. Jesse Jackson; and his mother, Jacqueline Jackson. His family will then take him to the halfway house. 'He said he'd have to report with his probation officer and he'd have to get some kind of job and start to put his life back together,' Kennedy said. Kennedy said he had not seen Jackson since August 2012, when he visited him at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota after Jackson took a leave from Congress and checked himself in for bipolar disorder. Kennedy has been an outspoken advocate on mental health issues. The two men served as Democrats in Congress together, and both have famous fathers. Kennedy's father was the late Sen. Edward Kennedy. SUMPTUOUS: Jackson's Washington, DC house got a decorator's touch, courtesy of his campaign donors . Among the items auctioned by the US Marshals Service was this framed and autographed cymbal from Michael Jackson's last concert tour . Bureau of Prisons spokesman Edmond Ross said he could not confirm that Jackson would be released to a halfway house, saying the bureau does not consider such plans public information. The Rev. Jesse Jackson directed inquiries to the Bureau of Prisons. He confirmed that Kennedy had met with his son. Messages left for attorneys for Jackson Jr. were not immediately returned. Kennedy said Jackson's mental health is much better than the last time he saw him at the Mayo Clinic. Kennedy said Jackson had even put a positive spin on his time in prison, saying it had allowed him to 'unplug' from the world. 'He's a lot more at ease with his role and responsibility with what got him into jail,' Kennedy said. He added that Jackson 'feels he's done his time.' Kennedy said they also talked about what's next. 'He's also very excited about what lies ahead for him in the future, which I think is very hopeful,' he said.", "answer": ["Former congressman pleaded guilty in 2013 to illegally spending $750,000 in campaign funds on himself and his wife – buying more than 3,000 items .\nSentenced to 30 months but will move to a halfway house tomorrow after serving barely half of that behind bars .\nAnother former Democratic congressman visited him in prison and learned about the impending move .\nJackson was diagnosed with bipolar disorder before his downward spiral .\nHis father is the civil rights activist and preacher Rev.

{"question": "They like Manchester band The Courteeners at Old Trafford. Upon winning their 20th Premier League title fans had the words of their song 'Not Nineteen Forever' made into a banner that takes pride of place at the Theatre of Dreams. But in the case of forgotten man Ander Herrera and his triumphant return to the side, the Middleton four-piece's earlier hit 'What Took You So Long?' would be more appropriate. Ander Herrera (centre) is starting to make an impact for Louis van Gaal's Manchester United side . Herrera has forged a strong bond with fellow Spaniard Juan Mata, who scored twice against Liverpool . What took you so long Louis van Gaal? Why was Herrera, suddenly a key player in United's new-found swagger, out of the picture for long chunks of the season? There is more than one answer. Firstly, if anyone is a 'club signing' it is Herrera. Long before the coronation of King Louis, United originally vowed to ensure he would be their man following his mesmerising role in Athletic Bilbao' 2011-12 Europa League victory over Sir Alex Ferguson's side. The admiration from within spread to the stands. They have never been shy of praising opponents at Old Trafford – this was where, in 2003, Ronaldo famously secured a standing ovation after a beautiful Champions League hat-trick for Real Madrid. The 25-year-old was signed from Athletic Bilbao in a £28.8million move following Van Gaal's arrival . Herrera made a bright start to his United career, but injury saw the Spaniard sidelined for several weeks . In that frantic and ultimately fruitless first summer David Moyes famously made one attempt to capture Herrera's services which ended in confusion after the complex hurdles within the player's contract could not be overcome. But they would not give up. When Van Gaal arrived talks were at an advanced stage with Herrera's representatives and he was happy to give the £28.8m move the green light with the new season approaching. United have paid more for only four others, but as we have heard more than once, under Van Gaal's philosophy the fee counts for nothing. Former United boss David Moyes made an attempt to capture Herrera's services, but failed . The Spanish midfielder is having to prove his worth to Van Gaal during his first season at Old Trafford . Herrera celebrates scoring during United's FA Cup fifth round victory against Preston in February . Not being the Dutchman's player, Herrera may have had to prove himself more than most. In a stuttering start to the season, he was not seen for a month after being substituted at half-time against West Bromwich Albion. As late as February he had completed 90 minutes just once since the 5-3 humbling at Leicester City in September. With their team struggling for rhythm United fans who remembered Herrera conducting the tune for Bilbao, scratched their heads at his continued absence. When he made a rare start in the 3-1 FA Cup win at Deepdale on February 16 many put it down to Van Gaal's squad rotation. Herrera's partnership with Daley Blind (right) has added tempo to what looked like a static midfield . But Herrera has started every game since, the kickstarting of his Old Trafford career coinciding with United finally clicking into gear. His partnership with Daley Blind has added tempo to what looked like a static midfield. Suddenly United appear as sharp as their 1980s shirt sponsors. Herrera's through ball for Juan Mata to open the scoring against Liverpool came in a dominant half of football United fans wondered if they would ever see again only weeks ago. But there is more to it than Herrera simply not being the boss's signing. In a wide-ranging interview with El Pais, he offered more clues. Herrera and Mata chase down Philippe Coutinho during United's 2-1 victory against Liverpool on Sunday . Mata puts the ball past Simon Mignolet for his firs goal following a brilliant throughball from Herrera . 'Van Gaal loves possession and doesn't like to risk [losing] the ball,' he said. 'He wants long possessions and to keep the ball because he believes you create spaces staying in the right place, because the team have the quality to find you. 'At the beginning he used to tell me off because I always looked for the ball, I wanted to have it, and I must wait for it.' Van Gaal is on the record stating his belief that his players must not play off the cuff – that they should know their jobs and if they do them his side will win. Michael Carrick (left) congratulates Herrera on the part he played in Mata's opening goal . It is a pragmatic cross-sports philosophy used in the NFL by New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick, whose team this year won their fourth Super Bowl this century. While it does not sound like the famous United Way, it certainly looked like it at Anfield. Herrera, superb on Merseyside, believes that if it had not been for football he would have tried a career in sports journalism. By the looks of things, he has plenty of new chapters to write at Old Trafford first.", "answer": ["Ander Herrera signed for Manchester United in £29m deal last summer .\nSpaniard has struggled to make an impact at Old Trafford .\nLouis van Gaal has seemed reluctant to use the 25-year-old .\nHerrera's has played his way into Van Gaal's starting XI .\nCLICK HERE for all the latest Manchester United news ."], "label": "SUM"}

General Assembly adopted a resolution in 2011 recognizing happiness as a \"fundamental human goal.\" The observation was decreed in 2012 after the first  U.N. conference on happiness, and the first Day of Happiness was held on March 20, 2013. Simpson said it makes sense to have music as such an important part of the day. \"I want to be able to share a message of happiness,\" the singer said. \"I think music is such an escape for people.\" He selected Bob Marley's \"Three Little Birds\" for the playlist. Britney Spears selected Prince's \"Kiss,\" and Pharrell picked Talking Heads' \"This Must Be the Place.\" Ed Sheeran, David Guetta, Charlize Theron, John Legend and James Blunt are also among those taking part. Simpson recently released a cover of Marley's \"No Woman No Cry\" and said the legendary reggae artist is a personal inspiration. \"The majority of music today has no substance,\" said Simpson, who is an independent artist. \"You want to be able to feel something true.\" As for what makes Simpson the happiest (other than music, of course), he said it's the simple things like relaxing with his family and just slowing down. \"Happiness is kind of taken from you if your mind is too busy,\" he said. \"Be present in that moment.\" Fans are being encouraged to post the song that makes them the happiest using the social media hashtag #HappySoundsLike.", "answer": ["Simpson helped curate the playlist to celebrate the UN's International Day of Happiness .\nHe will mark the day by performing at the SXSW festival .\nFans are encouraged to share the songs that make them happy ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "Sharron O'Neill always knew she had something. Even before she was diagnosed with cancer as a teenager, she knew her family had a stronger link to the deadly disease than others. When Ms O'Neill was diagnosed with Lynch syndrome in her late 20s, a genetic condition that makes someone more likely to get cancer, she said it wasn't surprise. Sharron O'Neil and her mother, Jilian Carter, both have Lynch syndrome. It is a genetic condition that makes someone 85 per cent more likely to get cancer . 'Our family always knew there was something; we just didn't know it was a gene and a specific thing,' Ms O'Neill said. 'But, once I found out about Lynch syndrome and knew what it was, it all started to make sense.' Mrs O'Neill was diagnosed with bowel cancer when she was just 19. A week earlier, her grandmother had died of pancreatic cancer. Her mother was diagnosed with uterine cancer at the age of 39. Her family history with cancer extends back much further, with Ms O'Neill saying she tracked it back more than 200 years. 'The farthest back I have been able to go is to a relative who came to Australia on a boat as an orphan in the early 1800s,' she said. 'It covers six generations that I know of.' Lynch syndrome is a genetic condition that makes people more susceptible to a number of cancers including bowel cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, pancreatic cancer, and stomach cancer, among many others. People with the gene have an 85 per cent chance of developing cancer before the age of 70. Ms O'Neill's great-grandmother died of cancer. Just five years later, her grandmother's sister did too. She said the family was 'on notice' from that point. In the following years, four of the five remaining children, including Ms O'Neill's grandmother,  faced three of more Lynch syndrome cancers, averaging out to almost one person per decade. Family ties: Mrs O'Neil's grandmother in the arms of her great grandmother . Lynch Syndrome Australia spokeswoman Beth Fairbank said approximately 20,000 Australians have the genetic condition, but only five per cent of people were diagnosed. 'There's 95 per cent of people walking around with it and they have no idea,' Ms Fairbank said. 'A lot of families that have a history of cancer think it's just a bit of bad luck and there's nothing that can be done about it, but in some cases it isn't bad luck and there are things that can be done. 'If there is such a thing, it can be a good cancer story. There are a lot of things that you can do and it really makes people aware and alert against it. 'People who know about the condition get checked much more regularly, which greatly reduces the overall risk from cancer.' Ms O'Neill said the most important thing is for people to start asking some potentially tough questions. 'There are a lot of factors that go into it, but everyone should be asking questions and looking at their family history,' she said. 'If a lot of people in your family under 50 have or had cancer, head to your GP and ask.' Lynch syndrome not only makes someone more likely to get cancer, but it also means they will likely get the disease earlier in life. In addition to that, Ms O'Neill said she had seen each person in her family get cancer at an early age than their parent or relative of the previous generation. That trend was one of the driving factors in why her and her husband decided against having children of their own. 'There are a lot of factors that went into it - our geneticist actually said it shouldn't stop us from having kids,' she said. 'But, it was a personal decision. I had seen people in my family get cancer at younger and younger ages. 'I was diagnosed at 19. The thought of having a child who would battle with cancer while they were or a teenager or at school was too much.' March 22 is Lynch Syndrome International Awareness Day and Australians are being urged to become aware of their family's cancer history . Lynch syndrome Australia director Eve Raets promoted the day at Rundle Mall in Adelaide over the weekend . March 22 is Lynch Syndrome International Awareness Day, and Mrs O'Neill said the day should be used to make sure people know about the condition. 'The key thing is that we really need to be raising awareness. 'There are a lot of people who don't want to know, but it has such a huge impact on families. 'Ask the questions.'", "answer": ["Sharron O'Neill can track cancer in her family back to the early 1800s .\n'Our family always knew there was something,' Mrs O'Neill says .\nMrs O'Neill was diagnosed with Lynch syndrome in her late 20s .\nIt is a genetic condition that makes people more likely to get cancer .\nAbout 20,000 Australians have the condition, but only 5% diagnosed .\nLynch syndrome Australia says more needs to be done to raise awareness ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "The pathetic excuses from friends and colleagues defending Steven Gerrard have been a joke. Unfortunately for arguably Liverpool’s greatest-ever player, he proved on Sunday that Brendan Rodgers has made the correct decision to cut him loose from Anfield at the end of this season. I’d be surprised if Gerrard makes the Liverpool starting line-up again, and any substitute appearances will surely only be to give the fans a wave goodbye. Why should Rodgers trust Gerrard again this season? Steven Gerrard looks dejected after seeing red just 38 seconds after coming on for Liverpool at Anfield . Gerrard stamped on Ander Herrera's right leg shortly after coming on at the start of the second half . Herrera gestures and points at Gerrard as the Liverpool midfielder reacts following the challenge . This is an experienced professional, a captain, a legend and there is nothing anyone can say that should mask the truth that he absolutely let everyone at Liverpool Football Club down. He also failed to apologise to Ander Herrera in his brief post-match interview, which showed a lack of class. Some said Gerrard was frustrated because he wasn’t in the starting line-up. That might be true, but it doesn’t excuse a violent stamp on an opponent’s ankle. Others have said he was desperate to get involved and show his passion. After all his years in the game, with all his knowledge of this fixture, he must surely know there is only one way to show passion and commitment on such a huge occasion – and that’s to make good, clean tackles, play well and get the job done. This was Liverpool’s biggest game of the season, against fierce rivals, it’s a game they’re losing when he comes on the pitch and it’s a game they need to win. Liverpool captain Gerrard looks baffled after seeing referee Martin Atkinson brandish a red card . Gerrard walks off the Anfield pitch in what was his last appearance against Man United in a Liverpool shirt . If Wayne Rooney had done it, the reaction would be far worse. There would be calls to strip him of the England captaincy. If it had been Joey Barton, the reaction would have hit fever pitch. Had it been a Chelsea player – well, the internet and the FA would have been in meltdown. There would have been talk of points deductions probably. But because it was Gerrard, the appropriate outrage has been tempered because apparently, according to the apologists, Rodgers made a mistake by failing to put him in the starting line-up. Gerrard (centre) walks past  Brendan Rodgers (left) as Emre Can (right) listens to instructions from his boss . Queens Park Rangers midfielder Joey Barton would have been ridiculed if he had made such a challenge . Last season’s slip against Chelsea was accidental, the stamp on Sunday was calculated: at best it was Gerrard being a careless hot-head desperate to make a mark. At worst, it looked like a reckless player who is now past caring about the fortunes of his club. Gerrard was the main man responsible for one of Liverpool’s most glorious nights back in 2005 in Istanbul. Nobody can ever take that away from him. Ten years on, there’s a good chance that Gerrard’s last significant act for his club could be a red card that proves to be a major factor in handing Manchester United a passage back into the Champions League – at Liverpool’s expense. Gerrard’s legacy is shattered. It’s a sad and sorry way to go, but he only has himself to blame.

{"question": "A 'deals on wheels' cannabis gang which used a parked Mazda near a university as its mobile drug den has been jailed. The group made £600 a day pushing the drug onto students in Cardiff after parking the black vehicle near its campus in Cathays. Four of its Kurdish members were jailed after being watched by police as they opened the car's door to one customer. Haram Kalaf (left) and Saman Ahmed (right) were among members of the gang which sold drugs from a black Mazda parked near Cardiff University . South Wales Police Officers found £3,650 of cannabis and £2,399 in cash inside. Haram Kalaf, 25, a failed asylum seeker and Saman Ahmed, 28, Nasir Karimi, 26, and Bakhutar Shakir, 28, were all handed sentences of between 13 and 21 months each. Cardiff Crown Court heard how the gang also used rental cars to shuttle drugs from the Mazda to customers. When police seized the vehicle they found 295 small bags of the drug hidden alongside thousands of pounds in cash stashed beneath the carpet. Nair Karimi had been living 'hand to mouth' for eight years before being jailed, the court heard . The gang was stopped when officers monitoring another of their cars watched them invite a young woman into the vehicle to buy £20 of the drug. 'The car door opened as if to draw her attention, she got in and left seconds later', prosecutor Jason Howells said. 'When she was stopped, she said \"I’m sorry, I don’t want to get into trouble. I’ve just bought some weed for £20\"'. After searching that vehicle, a Vauxhall Astra, they were taken to the Mazda where the majority of the haul was kept. Sentencing Judge Huw Rees said all of the men had come to the UK to sell drugs. 'You came here with a single purpose, to supply cannabis, making a lucrative profit. 'It was a well organised venture and the location you chose is significant - you came to an area of the city where students live, that intention is clear. 'And you used an extra vehicle with the sole purpose of storing your hoard so that if you were caught, you would only have small amounts on you.' Kalaf, a failed asylum seeker from Bristol, told police he was selling £600 of drugs every day. Ahmed, a father-of-two, was recruited as his driver while Karimi had been living 'hand to mouth' since arriving in the UK eight years earlier.

{"question": "A Penn State professor who was arrested on an American Airlines flight after lighting a cigarette and ranting about Obama said she was expressing an act of 'civil disobedience'. Dr Karen Halnon, 52, became an internet sensation after she was caught on camera lighting up shortly after a flight from Nicaragua landed at Miami International Airport on Saturday. Halnon said she used the moment to protest 'U.S. military global domination,' claiming the country has 'declared war on Venezuela' and was responsible for giving her hero Hugo Chavez cancer. Dr Karen Halnon, left in her police mugshot and right in a faculty photo, said she was expressing an act of 'civil disobedience' when she was filmed smoking and ranting about the US after her plane landed in Miami . The sociology professor also said the US was after Venezuela's water and oil. 'I had to speak out now,' she told Philadelphia Magazine. 'The situation is dire and urgent.' 'Any sacrifice I make for my own self, if it saves lives — there have been far too many lives lost due to U.S. global military domination.' Halnon claims she was 'tortured' by the FBI and TSA after she was arrested in Miami for disorderly conduct. 'I was put in a room with two fans in the ceiling, it was freezing cold for hours and hours and hours,' she said. Halnon alleged she was not allowed to go to the bathroom and had to wet her pants. She said she also defecated on the floor and was forced to pick it up while being 'laughed at'. A number of passengers around Halnon became angered after she lit up on the plane. The professor said the act was a 'symbol'. 'Every revolutionary I know smokes,' she said.

'They are going to kill many more people.' During her political rant aboard the flight Halnon, who said she teaches about US imperialism in Latin America, equated the country's tough economic sanctions against Venezuela with a declaration of war. According to an eyewitness, she also allegedly said that Obama 'kills people on Tuesdays'. Halnon shouted: 'The United States has declared war on Venezuela. Venezuela has been declared a national security threat.' 'You're a national security threat,' a passenger remarked off camera. 'She's gangster' another passenger said, laughing. Flight attendants warned the woman that the police would be waiting for her once the plane landed if she didn't calm down. But she yelled louder, ranting that Venezuela 'previously owned the oil in Venezuela.' 'My great hero Hugo Chavez nationalized the oil supply so that people would own the oil...not Exon Mobil.' After she was warned again by a flight attendant that she was going to be arrested, Halnon remarked 'I know already.' 'They already say they are arresting me so I'm going to tell you more,' she told passengers while unbuckling her seat belt and standing up. A statement from Penn State on Tuesday confirmed that Halnon is a member of staff.

{"question": "This well-heeled hamlet north of New York City is embroiled in an increasingly nasty debate that seems oddly out of place amid the stately homes and tony boutiques: What should be done about coyotes? Self-styled coyote spotters in and around Chappaqua have counted 160 incursions into backyards and streets over the last two years and at least 10 recent attacks on pets. That's been enough to stir animal passions among residents over the question of when and if a coyote deserves to be killed. Email and social media have swirled with such teeth-baring terms as 'coyote jihad' and 'death map.' And members of a local task force that advocates trapping and killing some of the animals announced they were staying away from a recent public hearing on the issue 'in the interest of our personal safety.' Scroll down for video . Victim: Pet owner Ann Styles Brochstein holds her Havanese dog Samson near where Samson was attacked by a coyote outside her home in Chappaqua, New York . Sighting: The New Castle Coyote Management Task Force is arguing for more frequent use of 'lethal solutions' against coyotes. A Facebook page for the group posted this photo of a coyote seen November 16, 2014 . Wounded: The anti-coyote New Castle Coyote Management Task Force included this photo of dogs injured by the wild animals at the end of a presentation . 'I envisioned going down there and having blood thrown on me,' said task force member Joyce Stansell-Wong, who has since resigned. Chappaqua, about 35 miles north of the city, is better known as the home of former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton than as a playground for coyotes. But wildlife officials say the demise of such predators as wolves and cougars over the last few decades has led to a spread of coyotes into more populated areas across the East Coast, including suburbs. Instagram and Facebook are replete with pictures of the canines scampering across sidewalks and among backyard playsets. Coyotes have even been spotted in New York City's Central Park and the Bronx. Robert Greenstein, supervisor of the Town of New Castle, which has about 18,000 residents in Chappaqua, Millwood and unincorporated areas, said that in general, the debate is between two camps: 'One group is concerned with protecting the coyotes and the other group is more concerned with protecting our pets.' The pet-protection camp, represented by the New Castle Coyote Management Task Force, argues for quicker use of 'lethal solutions.' Even though there have been no attacks on humans, they fear the skulking canines may start to attack small children. 'A menacing coyote, circling the playground, stalking children, that coyote has to go,' said task force member Ann Styles Brochstein, whose Havanese dog Samson was attacked by a coyote in their yard. Famous residents: Chappaqua, about 35 miles north of the city, is better known as the home of former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton than as a coyote playground (file photo) 'Residents have had to alter their lifestyle significantly,' she said. 'Taking out the garbage, grilling in backyards, walking children home from bus stops and the simple act of walking dogs have all attracted coyotes. They appear on porches and decks, looking through doors at children and pets.' A separate group, represented by the New Castle Coyote Awareness and Safety Advisory Committee, is advocating more tolerance, noting that coyote attacks on humans are very unusual and that a little education — and keeping pets on leashes — can help limit close encounters. In general, they would limit killings to coyotes that attack humans or leashed pets. 'We must encourage responsible pet ownership and not penalize a coyote for taking a small dog when such an act is only doing what comes naturally,' said Victoria Alzapiedi, chairwoman of the advisory committee. In the public meeting on the issue Feb. 10, the advisory committee gave its presentation. The absent task force submitted its presentation online. Both groups did extensive research, spoke with experts and appear to agree that coexistence is inevitable. They differ, however, on the current effectiveness of 'hazing' coyotes, or trying to instill a fear of humans by making a noisy commotion when a coyote is spotted. The task force says some coyotes have gotten used to such displays and pay scant attention. New York's Department of Environmental Conservation would have to approve any shooting or trapping. Coyotes that are trapped are then euthanized rather than taken to another area. The department's guidelines offer some perspective, noting that 650 New Yorkers are hospitalized every year for dog bites and that while coyotes kill cats, 'so do foxes, dogs, bobcats, vehicles and even great horned owls.' Dan Bogan, a coyote expert who consults for the DEC, said, 'We're never going to get rid of coyotes. They're not going anywhere. People aren't going anywhere either. Coexistence is the solution.' Greenstein said town board members are studying the proposals and will hold a public work session in the next month or two to discuss them. His prediction: 'That'll be Round 2 of the fireworks.'

{"question": "They simply do not draw games, and that’s something which could see Watford over the line in this season’s race to the Premier League. Not since late October, 21 fixtures ago, have the Hornets shared the points. It’s very much boom or bust under Slavisa Jokanovic and the pendulum is swinging in their direction at the moment. Against Fulham Troy Deeney’s 15th of the season secured their eighth win in the last ten. The signs are ominous for the rest and one of the first words out of the manager’s mouth afterwards was ‘champion’. Why not? They are just one point behind Middlesbrough. Troy Deeney (centre) fires home to give Watford the lead and send them third in the  Championship . The Hornets captain celebrates as his side continued their quest for an automatic promotion place . Watford starting XI (3-5-2): Gomes 6.5; Cathcart 7, Angella 7.5, Hoban 6; Motta 6, Abdi 8 (Forestieri - 86), Watson 7, Guedioura 7, Pudil 6.5 (Layun - 58 6); Deeney 7.5, Vydra 7 (Ighalo - 68 6) Subs not used: Bond, Paredes, Anya, Tozser, . Goals: Deeney 9 . Booked: Guedioura . Fulham starting XI (4-3-3): Bettinelli 6; Richards 6, Hutchinson 6, Bodurov 6, Stafylidis 6.5; Tunnicliffe 6, Fofana 7, Kavanagh 6.5 (Kačaniklić,- 76 6); Ruiz (Smith - 76 7), Woodrow 6.5 (Rodallega - 66 6), McCormack 7 . Subs not used: Kiraly, Hoogland, Amorebieta,  Dembélé . Booked: Richards, Fofana . ‘It’s nice winning 5-0 or 3-2 but sometimes it is difficult,’ Jokanovic said. ‘If you have a champion’s mentality you must suffer together and get through games like this. ‘They caused us problems. It’s positive for us because we were working all together. It wasn’t a brilliant game but you’ve got to be optimistic if you win these.’ It’s only six months since managerial turmoil looked to undermine the foundations previously laid when Billy McKinlay left after a matter of days but Watford will take some stopping from here. When all is said and done in two months’ time, they will make sure not to hold any regrets. The winner came on nine minutes after Fulham goalkeeper Marcus Bettinelli, rather bizarrely, opted to travel away from his goal to retrieve a ball for Almen Abdi to whip in a wicked corner; from that Craig Cathcart’s header was partially saved but Deeney was on the spot to smash in the rebound. ‘Disappointing’ was Kit Symons’ summation. ‘It’s the second phase of a corner.’ Jokanovic’s side are top scorers in the division - netting 16 in their last five at Vicarage Road before this - but are occasionally susceptible to pace and Ross McCormack might’ve drawn the visitors level soon after, only for his half-volley to be thwarted by former Tottenham stopper Heurelho Gomes. Ryan Tunnicliffe (centre) tussles with Almen Abdi for the ball during his side's defeat to Watford . Match winner Deeney fights with Kostas Stafylidis for possession during the first half at Vicarage Road . Despite Fulham looking bright, it was the Hornets who could’ve sewn the points up before half-time. Abdi is afforded the freedom to roam from his central berth and that gives Watford an added dimension. Capped by Switzerland, he buzzes in possession and isn’t afraid of bypassing Deeney and Matej Vydra in pursuit of goals. Here the two strikers combined brilliantly to tee Abdi up and he thumped just wide. Make no mistake, this was not vintage Watford but you sense they don’t need to be weekly, such is the quality stacked up in a well-stocked squad. Vydra crashed an effort against the bar after sparkling Adlene Guedioura footwork before Jazz Richards only saw yellow for raising his hands to the striker off the ball. Ben Watson (centre) climbs higher than Bryan Ruiz during his side's crucial victory over Fulham . Symons saw Cauley Woodrow head over from a corner and Seko Fofana’s vicious strike was deflected wide. Fulham failed to build a real period of sustained pressure until introducing giant striker Matt Smith; his knockdown fell to McCormack but Gomes rushed out, spread himself and superbly blocked the Scot’s certain equaliser. ‘Matt did well when he came on,’ Symons said. ‘He’s a physical presence up there and we can play a bit more direct. There was a chance at the end when Hugo Rodallega and Ross got in each other’s way. We deserved a point.’ Watford might usually be a pleasure to watch, but they’ll be thankful for that mad Brazilian between the sticks - this ended up being as gritty as they come.", "answer": ["Watford move into third in the Sky Bet Championship following the win .\nTroy Deeney opened the scoring for high-flying Watford after nine minutes .\nHeurelho Gomes made crucial saves to prevent a Fulham equaliser ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "Nick Gordon's stepfather has revealed in a new interview that he fears for the life of Bobbi Kristina's troubled fiance. It has been reported that Gordon, 25, has threatened suicide and has been taking Xanax since Whitney Houston's daughter was found unconscious in a bathtub in late January. On Wednesday, Access Hollywood spoke exclusively to Gordon’s stepfather about his son's state of mind, asking him if he fears for Nick's life. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Nick Gordon's father (left and right) gave an interview about the 25-year-old fiance of Bobbi Kristina Brown, who reportedly had threatened suicide . Access Hollywood will air the complete interview Thursday . 'I fear... that if something happens to Bobbi Kristina, like, if she doesn't pull it through, then I will fear for my son's life,' the stepfather stated. Access Hollywood will air the complete interview Thursday. Speaking to Dr Phil McGraw Gordon, 25, said: ‘I lost the most legendary singer ever and I’m scared to lose Krissy. I want to let all you guys know I did everything possible in the world to protect them.’ Gordon’s impassioned assertion was made during a dramatic intervention staged by Dr Phil last week and due to air today. Weeping and wailing and at times incoherent, Gordon had believed that he was to be interviewed by Dr Phil. Gordon had told the eminent psychologist that he wanted to tell his side of the story. He has felt ‘vilified’ and ‘depicted as a monster’ since January 31 when Bobby Kristina, 22, was found face down and unresponsive in the bath-tub at the Roswell , Georgia home he and Bobby Kristina shared. Breakdown: With his mother, Michelle, by his side Nick Gordon struggles to stay coherent . Troubling preview: A trailer for the interview of Bobbi Kristina Brown's boyfriend Nick Gordon by Dr Phil McGraw was released Sunday night. Swinging from crying  to flying into a rage, the disturbing 30 second video shows a very troubled young man in a lot of pain as he is questioned by Dr Phil . But on learning of Gordon’s emotional, mental and physical state Dr Phil could not ‘in good conscience’ go on with the interview. According to Gordon’s mother, Michelle, who was by her son’s side during the highly emotional intervention, ‘Nicholas is at a breaking point. He cannot bear not being without Krissy, by her side. He’s dealing with it by drinking. I’ve begged him to stop.’ Dr Phil told Gordon, who admitted to having taken Xanax and to have drunk heavily prior to the meeting: ‘Nick, you’re out of control. You’ve threatened suicide. You deserved to get some help because if you don’t, you know you’re going to wind up dead.’ He added: ‘You’ve got to get yourself cleaned up. You got to man up and straighten up.’ Yesterday DailyMail.com revealed that, barely 12 hours before the dramatic encounter with Dr Phil, Gordon was so drunk and high he was unable to walk. The disturbing scenes captured on video showed the true extent of a deterioration described by Dr Phil as ‘exponential.’ In the show, due to broadcast Wednesday, a weeping and wailing Gordon admitted that he has twice tried to kill himself and confessed: ‘I’m so sorry for everything.’ Asked if he still intended to kill himself he said: ‘If anything happens to Krissi I will.’ He said: ‘My pain is horrible. My heart hurts. I have panic attacks.’ In recent weeks Gordon has twice overdosed on a mixture of Xanax, alcohol and prescription sleeping pills. Gordon had agreed to meet with Dr Phil believing that he was there to be interviewed. According to Dr Phil: 'He felt like he was being vilified and presented as some sort of monster.' Instead, on learning of Gordon's rapidly deteriorating mental, emotional and physical state, the eminent psychologist staged an intervention and he is now in rehab. Dr Phil stated: 'I don't think he has any chance of turning this round. Left to his own devices he will be dead within the week.' Gordon's mother, Michelle, was by her son's side as he alternated between compliant and aggressive – at one point threatening to attack camera men as they filmed. She described her son as 'at breaking point.' She said: 'He cannot take too much more of not being able to see Kriss. He blames himself. He's torn up and carrying guilt. 'He's dealing with it by drinking. I've begged him to stop. I've tried to help him but he can't let go of the guilt.' Leaning towards Gordon's mother, Dr Phil said: 'You and I have one mission with one possible outcome and that's for him to agree to go to rehab to deal with his depression, his guilt…and to get clean and sober.' He added: 'His life absolutely hangs in the balance.' Questions still rage regarding just what happened in the early hours of January 31st that led to Bobbi Kristina, 22, ending up face down in her tub. Just two days ago Bobbi Kristina's aunt, Leolah Brown, made a series of explosive Facebook posts in which she alleged that the family had 'strong evidene of foul play' relating to Gordon's role in events. She posted: 'Nick Gordon is very disrespectful and inconsiderate! Especially to my family. Moreover, he has done things to my niece that I never thought he had in him to do!' Leolah made her claims in response to being invited onto Dr Phil's show. Tough to watch: The young man sobs and shakes at times through the trailer . In her message she wrote: 'With all due respect, Nick Gordon is under investigation for the attempted murder of my niece….We have strong evidence of foul play.' Marks were found on her face and arms, marks that Gordon has explained as the result of CPR which he administered to her for 15 minutes before emergency services arrived. And speaking to Dr Phil, Gordon insisted: 'I did everything possible in the world to protect them [Whitney and Bobbi Kristina].' Railing against the decision by Bobbi's father, Bobby Brown, to ban him from his fiancée's bedside at Atlanta's Emory Hospital, Gordon said: 'My name will be the first she calls.' According to his mother, Michelle, Gordon cannot forgive himself for his 'failure' to revive Bobbi Kristina. His guilt is compounded by the eerily similar situation in which he found himself almost exactly three years earlier. 'I hate Bobby Brown!' His tears quickly turn to anger when he brings up his girlfriend's father Bobby Brown, who has blocked him from seeing the 22-year-old in the hospital . 'Are you drinking?' The emotional man's anger only increases as Dr. Phil asks about Nick's sobriety . Refuses to go: The 25-year-old aspiring rapper storms out when told he needs help . Resigned: Ultimately, Gordon concedes that he needs help and leaves for a rehab facility . Then, on 11 February 2012, it was Gordon who tried to resuscitate Whitney when she was found unresponsive in her bath-tub just hours before she was due to attend a Grammy awards party. Speaking to Dr Phil, Michelle said: 'Nicholas just continually expresses how much he has failed Whitney. 'He administered CPR [to Whitney] and he called me when he was standing over her body. He couldn't understand why he couldn't revive her. He said, \"Mommy why? I couldn't get the air into her lungs.\" Gordon has now entered a rehab facility in Atlanta. Meanwhile his fiancée continues to fight for her life in a medically-induced coma. It is now six weeks since Bobbi Kristina – Krissi as she was known to friends - was found face down and unresponsive in the bath-tub of the home she shared with Gordon in Roswell, Georgia. Unlike Whitney's death that was ruled accidental, police are treating Bobbi Kristina's near drowning and injuries allegedly sustained by the 22-year-old as a criminal investigation. While Bobbi Kristina fights for her life a troubling picture of her relationship with Nick, of drug use and domestic turbulence in the weeks leading up to the incident, has emerged. In an interview with The Sun  a friend of the couple, Steven Stepho, claimed they were using various drugs daily including heroin, Xanax, pot and heroin substitute Roxicodone. Sounding eerily similar to Bobbi's mother and father's drug-dependent relationship, the friend said the pair used whatever they could get their hands on. 'Bobbi and Nick would spend a lot on drugs every day, it just depended on how much money they had. It wasn't unusual for them to spend $1,000 a day on drugs. 'There were times when it got really bad - they would be completely passed out for hours, just lying there on the bed. There were times when she would be so knocked out she would burn herself with a cigarette and not even notice. She was always covered in cigarette burns.' Their relationship was also very volatile. 'When Whitney died Nick was left with nothing, so he knew he had to control Krissi to get access to the money. She'd do whatever he told her. 'He was very manipulative and would even use the drugs to control her. They would argue a lot and there were times when he would be violent with her and push her around.' According to Stepho: 'But Krissi really loved him because he was there to fill the gap left by her mother. She was not close to her father and did not have anyone else close to her. Nick knew this and took advantage of it.' Troubled relationship: A friend of the couple, Steven Stepho, claimed the pair were using various drugs daily including heroin, Xanax, pot and heroin substitute Roxicodone .", "answer": ["Nick Gordon's father spoke to Access Hollywood about the 25-year-old fiance of Bobbi Kristina .\nDr. Phil McGraw staged a highly-charged intervention with Nick Gordon that will be broadcast on his show today .\nGordon is now in rehab after the intervention having been drinking heavily and taking Xanax .\nGirlfriend Bobbi Kristina has been in a medically induced coma since January 31 and Gordon has not been allowed to see her ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "(CNN)CNN has learned that the manufacturer of the endoscope involved in two superbug deaths at UCLA never obtained permission to sell the device, according to an official at the Food and Drug Administration. Olympus started selling its TJF-Q180V duodenoscope in 2010, but the FDA didn't notice until late 2013 or early 2014 that the company had never asked for clearance to put it on the market, according to Karen Riley, deputy director of strategy for the FDA's Office of External Affairs. \"Why didn't we notice it? I don't know,\" Riley said. \"Can you imagine a prescription drug getting out on the market that didn't go through the approval process?\" asked Dr. Steven Nissen, the chief of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, who's testified to Congress about device safety problems. \"Devices need to be regulated more vigorously. This is really disturbing.\" In a statement, Olympus said it didn't think needed the FDA's permission to sell the device, but now at the request of the agency, it has applied for that permission. That application is still pending. Seven hospital patients at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center were infected with the deadly superbug CRE -- also known as carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae -- from October to January, according to hospital officials. Two of those patients died. The patients caught CRE after routine endoscopic treatments. Hospital officials believe two medical scopes that still carried the deadly bacteria even after disinfection guidelines were followed were the cause of the superbug outbreak. The medical center has contacted 179 others who had endoscopic procedures between October and January and is offering them home tests to screen for the bacteria. Four other patients at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles have also been infected with  the superbug linked to a contaminated  duodenoscope, according to a statement released by the hospital. The medical scope was used in all four patients, between August and January 2015. Sixty-four other patients who had a duodenoscope procedure with that particular scope are being informed by mail, \"out of an abundance of caution.\" According to FDA rules, a manufacturer must seek clearance for a new model if it includes changes that \"could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device.\" The TJF-Q180V duodenoscope, used to check out ducts in the gastrointestinal system, includes a modification to the exact part of the device that's been implicated in the superbug outbreaks. With this new model, Olympus sealed up that part of the device, known as the elevator channel, hoping to make it more impervious to infection. \"The company clearly made these modifications to make the device safer, but it seems to be that it wasn't safer,\" Riley said. Last year, at the FDA's request, Olympus applied for permission to sell the scope. That application is still pending. Riley emphasized that duodenoscope procedures can be lifesaving, so the agency doesn't want to take them off the market. \"More than 500,000 of these procedures are done every year in the U.S., and the risk of bacterial transmission is actually really very, very low,\" she said. \"We believe the benefits outweigh the risks.\" In its statement, Olympus wrote: \"The emergence of drug-resistant microorganisms is a challenge to the entire health care community.  Olympus is working with relevant medical societies and our customers in research of this emerging issue and the development of additional safeguards to prevent infection associated with [duodenoscope procedures].\" Riley noted that the other two duodenoscope manufacturers, Pentax and Fujifilm, did apply for and were granted clearance to market models similar to Olympus' TJF-Q180V. Now the FDA is asking all three companies to submit evidence that the scopes can be thoroughly cleaned -- and so far it's not going well. Riley said twice the companies have submitted data that failed to show that cleaning could get rid of 99.9999% of all microbes on the scope -- the FDA's standard for disinfection. \"We're still working with them to get good data,\" she said. Riley said she doesn't know if the FDA will penalize Olympus for selling the device without permission. Diana Zuckerman, a device safety expert, said they should. \"It's like with kids. How do you teach your children to behave if there are no consequences when they misbehave?\" she said.", "answer": ["FDA official says Olympus never got permission to sell its endoscope .\nMedical device is connected to CRE outbreak in California that's left two people dead ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "Roberto Di Matteo admitted he was finding Schalke's Champions League exit hard to take in after his side scored four at Real Madrid on Tuesday but still failed to make it past the holders and into the  quarter-finals. Schalke produced one of the best performances of the season to claim a 4-3 victory at the Bernabeu but were eliminated 5-4 on aggregate after losing last month's last 16 first leg in Gelsenkirchen 2-0. 'On the one hand we are of course very happy that we managed to win but at the same time it's a bit hard to take in that we scored four goals in Madrid and didn't get through,' Italian Di Matteo told a news conference.

Former Chelsea boss Di Matteo admitted Schalke's Champions League exit was hard to take after netting four . Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored twice against his former club as Schalke were eliminated . Netherlands striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, a former Real player, struck twice for the Bundesliga side, including an 84th-minute stunner that put them within a goal of pulling off a remarkable comeback. It was Real's first Champions League defeat at home in 22 games since Barcelona beat them 2-0 in April 2011 and was only the second time they had conceded four goals in a European game at the Bernabeu. However, a Cristiano Ronaldo double and a Karim Benzema strike were enough to secure a place for Real in the draw for the last eight on March 20. The Dutch striker's brace was not enough to see the Bundeliga outfit though after a 2-0 defeat in the first leg . 'I was hoping we could go into the break 2-1 up but we unfortunately didn't manage it. That would of course have made the game more interesting for us,' added Di Matteo. 'Perhaps we just didn't have that little bit of luck tonight that you need to get through such ties.' Schalke return to action in the Bundesliga with a game at Hertha Berlin on Saturday.

{"question": "(CNN)For the second time, a Georgia woman's execution has been postponed -- this time because of concerns about the drugs to be used. Kelly Renee Gissendaner was scheduled to die at 7 p.m. ET Monday. \"Prior to the execution, the drugs were sent to an independent lab for testing of potency. The drugs fell within the acceptable testing limits,\" the Georgia Department of Corrections said in a statement. \"Within the hours leading up to the scheduled execution, the Execution Team performed the necessary checks. At that time, the drugs appeared cloudy. The Department of Corrections immediately consulted with a pharmacist, and in an abundance of caution, Inmate Gissendaner's execution has been postponed.\" The 47-year-old was originally scheduled to die on Wednesday, but that execution was called off because of winter weather. A petition saying the mother of three has turned her life around, even earning a theology degree while in prison, had garnered about 80,000 signatures as of Tuesday morning. Organizers plan to deliver it to Gov. Nathan Deal, though in Georgia, the governor has no authority to grant clemency. Gissendaner has become a \"powerful voice for good,\" the petition says of the woman convicted of orchestrating her husband's death in 1997. \"While incarcerated, she has been a pastoral presence to many, teaching, preaching and living a life of purpose,\" the petition states. \"Kelly is a living testament to the possibility of change and the power of hope. She is an extraordinary example of the rehabilitation that the corrections system aims to produce.\" On Sunday night, about 200 people attended a vigil at Emory University's Cannon Chapel, where they sang her praises. \"Killing her is not going to bring anything back. It's not going to undo what's been done,\" priest Kelly Zappa told CNN affiliate WSB. The pleas did not sway Georgia's high court or its board of pardons. In a 5-2 decision Monday afternoon, the state Supreme Court denied her request for a stay, and it also dismissed a constitutional challenge claiming that her sentence was disproportionate. And the State Board of Pardons and Paroles said Monday evening that its decision last week to deny clemency in the case stands. Not since Lena Baker, an African-American convicted of murder and pardoned decades later, has Georgia executed a woman. The state was scheduled to snap that 70-year streak last week before Gissendaner's execution was first postponed. Just hours before she was scheduled to die by injection at the Georgia Diagnostic and Classification State Prison in Jackson last Wednesday, the Georgia Department of Corrections announced it had postponed the execution until Monday at 7 p.m. \"due to weather and associated scheduling issues,\" department spokeswoman Gwendolyn Hogan said. Gissendaner was convicted in a February 1997 murder plot that targeted her husband in suburban Atlanta. She was romantically involved with Gregory Owen and conspired with the 43-year-old to have her husband, Douglas Gissendaner, killed, according to court testimony. Owen wanted Kelly Gissendaner to file for a divorce, but she was concerned that her husband would \"not leave her alone if she simply divorced him,\" court documents said. The Gissendaners had already divorced once, in 1993, and they remarried in 1995. Details of the crime, as laid out at trial and provided by Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens, are as follows: . Kelly Gissendaner and Owen planned the murder for months. On February 7, 1997, she dropped Owen off at her home, gave him a nightstick and hunting knife, and went out dancing with girlfriends. Douglas Gissendaner also spent the evening away from home, going to a church friend's house to work on cars. Owen lay in wait until he returned. When Douglas Gissendaner came home around 11:30 p.m., Owen forced him by knifepoint into a car and drove him to a remote area of Gwinnett County. There, Owen ordered his victim into the woods, took his watch and wallet to make it look like a robbery, hit him in the head with the nightstick and stabbed Douglas Gissendaner in the neck eight to 10 times. Kelly Gissendaner arrived just as the murder took place, but she did not immediately get out of her car. She later checked to make sure her husband was dead, then Owen followed her in Douglas Gissendaner's car to retrieve a can of kerosene that Kelly Gissendaner had left for him. Owen set her husband's car on fire in an effort to hide evidence and left the scene with Kelly Gissendaner. Police discovered the burned-out automobile the morning after the murder but did not find the body. Authorities kicked off a search. Kelly Gissendaner, meanwhile, went on local television appealing to the public for information on her husband's whereabouts. Her and Owen's story started to unravel after a series of police interviews. On February 20, Douglas Gissendaner's face-down body was found about a mile from his car. An autopsy determined the cause of death to be knife wounds to the neck, but the medical examiner couldn't tell which strike killed Douglas Gissendaner because animals had devoured the skin and soft tissue on the right side of his neck. On February 24, Owen confessed to the killing and implicated Kelly Gissendaner, who was arrested the next day and charged. While in jail awaiting trial, Kelly Gissendaner grew angry when she heard that Owen was to receive a 25-year sentence for his role in the murder. (Owen is serving life in prison at a facility in Davisboro, according to Georgia Department of Corrections records.) She began writing letters to hire a third person who would falsely confess to taking her to the crime scene at gunpoint. She asked her cellmate, Laura McDuffie, to find someone willing to do the job for $10,000, and McDuffie turned Kelly Gissendaner's letters over to authorities via her attorney. Kelly Gissendaner has exhausted all state and federal appeals, the attorney general said in a statement last week. In the clemency application, Gissendaner's lawyers argued she was equally or less culpable than Owen, who actually did the killing. Both defendants were offered identical plea bargains before trial: life in prison with an agreement to not seek parole for 25 years. Owen accepted the plea bargain and testified against his former girlfriend. Gissendaner was willing to plead guilty, her current lawyers said, but consulted with her trial lawyer and asked prosecutors to remove the stipulation about waiting 25 years to apply for parole. According to her clemency appeal, her lead trial attorney, Edwin Wilson, said he thought the jury would not sentence her to death \"because she was a woman and because she did not actually kill Doug. ... I should have pushed her to take the plea but did not because I thought we would get straight up life if she was convicted.\" Her appeal lawyers also argued that Gissendaner had expressed deep remorse for her actions, become a model inmate and grown spiritually. They said her death would cause further hardship for her children. For her last meal, she requested an extravagant one: two Burger King Whoppers with cheese (with everything), two large orders of fries, popcorn, cornbread, a side of buttermilk and a salad with tomatoes, bell peppers, onions, carrots, cheese, boiled eggs and Newman's Own buttermilk dressing, the Corrections Department said. She also requested a glass of lemonade and cherry-vanilla ice cream for dessert. According to the Death Penalty Information Center: . • Between 1973 and 2012 -- the most recent data available -- 178 death sentences were imposed upon female offenders. These sentences constitute about 2% of all death sentences. • Five states -- North Carolina, Florida, California, Ohio and Texas -- account for over half of all such sentences. • As of December 31, 2012, there were 61 women on death row. • Women on death row range in age from 28 to 79. They have been on death row from a few months to over 26 years. Currently the only woman on Georgia's death row, Gissendaner would be the second woman in the state's history to be executed. The first was Baker, an African-American maid who was sentenced to death by an all-white, all-male jury in 1944. She claimed self-defense for killing a man who held her against her will, threatened her life and appeared poised to hit her with a metal bar before she fired a fatal shot. Sixty years after her execution, Georgia's parole board posthumously pardoned her after finding that \"it was a grievous error to deny (her) clemency.\" Such pardons are rare, but so are executions of women. According to the Death Penalty Information Center, only 15 women have been executed in the United States since 1977.

Navy veteran Vanessa Hicks, a Virginia Beach photographer whose website is filled with sweet images of babies and their parents, shot the picture of the sailor and his baby and posted it to her Facebook page. \"I do believe that this picture right here shows what it means to be an American,\" Hicks told CNN affiliate WTKR.\"That flag, the uniform, that baby -- exactly what every service member is out there fighting.\" Not everyone agreed with Hicks, herself a Navy wife whose husband is deployed. A Facebook page titled \"You call yourself a photographer?\" posted her photo and said that the use of the flag as a prop was a desecration -- and a bad picture. The U.S. Flag Code does state that the flag should never be used as \"wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery.  It should never be festooned, drawn back, nor up, in folds, but always allowed to fall free,\" according to a Congressional Research Service report (PDF). Nor should it be \"used as a receptacle for receiving, holding, carrying, or delivering anything.\" The threatening private messages, which she has reported to Facebook, saddened her. But she decided to keep posting the picture and to take pictures of other members of the military who request the same picture with their babies and the flag. Most people posting to the critical Facebook page disagree with the criticism of the picture. Wrote one poster, \"I am a veteran and find this picture beautiful.

{"question": "It says something for the way things have changed in English football that Arsene Wenger admitted only last week that Arsenal have no chance of winning the Barclays Premier League. The same, of course, could be said of Manchester United. It is, we should remind ourselves, only the start of March. Given United’s enduring financial capacity, it should not be too long before the most successful club of the Premier League era are competing with Manchester City and Chelsea at the top of the table once more.

Manchester United duo Antonio Valencia and Daley Blind are both expected to start against Arsenal . United duo Jones (left) and Falcao (right) will be hoping to start against Arsene Wenger's side . As for Arsenal, it is more difficult to say. Arsene Wenger’s team have been a peripheral concern for quite a while now. Whatever the case, on Monday night at Old Trafford, these great modern rivals come together with something more at stake than a place in the last four of the FA Cup. With United not involved in Europe this season and Arsenal staring at likely Champions League expulsion in Monaco next week — they trail 3-1 after the last-16 home leg — victory tonight would at least keep one of them relevant from a domestic point of view. No wonder United staff have been encouraging supporters to bring flags and banners to Old Trafford in a bid to bolster tonight’s atmosphere. This may not be a cup final but it may feel a little bit like one. ‘United and Arsenal are placed third and fourth in the Premier League so it’s almost like a final, I think,’ said United manager Louis van Gaal. ‘It is a big event with two good teams. I hope we can give a fantastic match for the fans. United boss Louis van Gaal is targeting his first piece of silverware since arriving at Old Trafford last summer . Wayne Rooney during United's training session at Carrington on Sunday ahead of the game . ‘I think if we beat them it is a big blow for them but if they beat us it is a big blow for us. It is a very important game, not only for the FA Cup but also for the rest of the season.’ United have not won the FA Cup for 11 years. Arsenal are the holders after last season’s victory over Hull but, prior to that, their previous success in the competition had come back in 2005. This says much for the manner in which both clubs’ focus has been elsewhere for so long. Arsenal and United have always valued the FA Cup but, during the years they disputed the league title and had grand aspirations in Europe, it was occasionally allowed to slide down the priority list. That is no longer the case. Van Gaal in particular has been respectful towards the game’s most famous cup competition ever since he arrived in Manchester last summer and has made no attempt to hide what it would mean to him — and his club — if United could win it. The first trophy Van Gaal ever won as a coach was Holland’s KNVB Cup with Ajax in 1993. He still considers his first Dutch championship, which arrived a year later, as the most important trophy of his coaching career. But he admitted he understood Jose Mourinho’s view that his most crucial success in England was his first — the 2005 League Cup triumph. Francis Coquelin evads the challenge for Aaron Ramsey during Arsenal's Sunday training session at Colney . Arsenal forward Danny Welbeck gets through some speed work at his side's St Albans base .

The Gunners squad are put through their paces as they look to reach Wembley for the third time in two years . Laurent Koscielny puts in the effort with a sprint as Wengers' team got ready for the vital game at Old Trafford . ‘You can say you play for your profession but that is not enough,’ said Van Gaal. ‘You want to win something. That is why you play and coach. The players want to win something and also the manager and also the fans. ‘When you win a title like the FA Cup, which in England is very important, and when you fight for something and you get it, you are pleased and that is why Jose Mourinho is saying what he says about his first one. ‘When you compare coaches with one another then titles are very important. And when a player wins something, they then have the experience of winning a final so there are a lot of positive things.’ Van Gaal was not hired last summer to win the FA Cup. He knows he must get United back into the Champions League. No Premier League club with aspirations of winning the league can afford to be locked out of money-spinning European competition for more than the odd season. Similarly, Wenger knows what his true responsibilities are. French centre forward Olivier Giroud is finally looking capable of scoring consistently for the Gunners . On Monday night, however, the expectation is that this should feel like the most important night of these teams’ seasons so far and the contest should benefit from that. Arsenal have been playing reasonably well for some time and have won 10 of their last 11 domestic games. With their French centre forward Olivier Giroud finally looking capable of scoring consistently, the holders will head north knowing they have the capacity to trouble their great rivals. They also have a league defeat from early winter to avenge. Arsene Wenger's side are current FA Cup champions after their dramatic victory against Hull last season . United’s football, on the other hand, has been more patchy but Van Gaal will hope that inspiration can be taken from an away win at Newcastle last Wednesday that had an important feel about it. He will also hope his captain Wayne Rooney can use his own rather sketchy FA Cup past as a motivating factor. ‘He has not won the FA Cup,’ said Van Gaal. ‘And that is something that is missing for him. ‘My first championship with Ajax was very important for me, it was also an emotional thing. It will be the same for Wayne.’", "answer": ["Manchester United face Arsenal in the FA Cup sixth-round on Monday .\nUnited are not involved in Europe this season .\nWhile Arsenal are staring at likely Champions League expulsion in Monaco .\nArsene Wenger's side trail 3-1 after the last-16 home leg at the Emirates .\nUnited have not won the FA Cup for 11 years .\nMartin Keown hopes United will play with more freedom on Monday night ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "Teacher Kim Davies, pictured, vowed that she would have no problems in being a whistleblower again despite being reprimanded by a watchdog . A teacher who complained about an unruly pupil and went on sick leave was spied upon by the local education authority while she was on sick leave. Kim Davies, who has taught English for the past 28 years, faced the prospect of being hit with a classroom ban following allegations of misconduct. A General Teaching Council For Wales (GTCW) hearing in Cardiff was told Mrs Davies became a thorn in the side of education officials after lodging more than 20 complaints about a colleague and nine to an exam board. The 56-year-old was later followed by a team of private investigators after her dispute with bosses saw her signed off by a doctor on grounds of stress. Caerphilly County Council took the drastic action after suspecting the mother-of-two was defrauding the sickness absence system - but the Information Commissioner's Office later ruled the local authority was wrong to begin the surveillance. However, she was still hauled before the GTCW - who found she had broken confidentiality rules about her disciplinary procedure as well as making 'vexatious' complaints. Among the penalties available to the body included striking Mrs Davies' name from the teaching register - a move she said would have not only cost her job but also her home. A panel decided against the more severe sanctions - and said she can carry on teaching provided she promises not to cause problems again. Mrs Davies denied being a troublemaker and said she was 'fighting injustice' after her complaint about a pupil's behaviour was not taken seriously. She said: 'I am relieved that I am able to carry on teaching. I don't know what I would have done if that was taken from me - it would have had a massive effect on my welfare and happiness as well as my financial circumstances. 'I've been through four years of hell - not only has there been the prospect of losing my home but also my job. 'But despite everything that I have been through it would not put me off on blowing the whistle again. 'This issue unravelled following a complaint about the safety of pupils and staff. It is the job of a teacher to ensure pupils are safe in the classroom. 'I care too much about my pupils and their welfare. 'Even though they decided the allegations against were proven, I always believed what I was doing was right. 'And if you can live with your conscience, then you can survive.' The GTCW heard that Mrs Shaw, from Blackwood, south Wales, became embroiled in a row with bosses at Pontllanfraith Comprehensive School after lodging a complaint about a problem pupil's 'threatening behaviour'. After feeling the issue was not taken seriously, she was subject to disciplinary proceedings in 2010 before finally being dismissed two years later. During her period of suspension, it was found she breached confidentiality rules during the school's internal disciplinary processes and made 'vexatious allegations' to exam board WJEC in an attempt to bring the school into disrepute. Case presenter Lousha Reynolds said the registrant also behaved inappropriately towards her line manager, her head of department and headteacher Robert Davies - whom she called 'an idiot' and referred to him being in his 'ivory tower'. Ms Reynolds added: 'She felt her behaviour was justified because she wanted to make people pay, because she felt a sense of injustice. 'We heard today that she didn't want the education of pupils to be jeopardised, but there is still no insight into her failings. 'She was only suspended because of the way she acted towards her disciplinary proceeding.' Ms Davies had raised issues at Pontllanfraith Comprehensive School, pictured, about a 'problem pupil' However, while the row rumbled on it emerged that Caerphilly Council paid private investigators £3,600 to tail Mrs Shaw for three days - a move the Information Commissioner's Office later called 'unlawful'. In mitigation, Mrs Shaw told the GTCW she had been absolutely devastated by the events of the past four years. 'I had built up a reputation over 28 years in one school and to have that questioned and to be accused of malpractice decimated everything I believed I stood for,' she said. NASUWT representative Colin Adkins told the hearing Mrs Shaw believed she was being disciplined after raising 'a serious safeguarding matter'. He said: 'Mrs Shaw believed that was done by challenging her professional integrity, which she found personally devastating. 'She has suffered a serious detriment already - financially and personally - for pursuing matters she believed she was right to pursue. 'I believe the public interest is best served by allowing Mrs Shaw to continue teaching. Quite clearly, she's a good teacher.' Panel chairman Steve Powell said the GTCW was satisfied Mrs Shaw failed to 'behave professionally' during her disciplinary process and her actions 'fell short of what is expected of a registered teacher'. Mrs Shaw, who has been a supply teacher for the past two years, was handed a conditional registration order. It means she can carry on teaching provided she fulfils certain requirements, such as any employer having to submit a report on her progress. Following the decision, she said: 'I'm still trying to take in the implications of what this means but for now I just want to get back doing what I do best - teaching.'", "answer": ["Teacher Kim Davies made more than 20 complaints against a colleague .\nShe lodged a further nine complaints with an exam board .\nMs Davies faced a classroom ban following allegations of misconduct .\nThe teacher was followed by private detectives after taking sick leave .\nCaerphilly Council thought Ms Davies was trying to defraud the system .\nMs Davies was reprimanded by a watchdog for breaking a number of rules .\nShe was also criticised for making several vexatious complaints .\nMs Davies avoided a classroom ban following the watchdog's hearing .\nShe said she now wanted to get back into the classroom and teach ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "Researchers studying nature have turned to a new frontier they say could be more diverse than anmost anywhere else - homes. They say indoor spaces could be the fastest growing biome, a word used to describe the different realms of life on Earth. Researchers estimate that the indoor biome makes up about 0.5 percent of ice-free land, or about 247,000 square miles, almost the size of Texas. The various organisms living in homes and other indoor spaces rarely has been researched, with sparse studies of rodents and German cockroaches, researchers say. A study of 40 houses in North Carolina used genomic technologies to document the inhabitants. It found more than 8,000 bacterial and archaeal taxa. Another study of 50 houses in the same state described more than 750 types of arthropods, including insects and spiders . An examination of 11 houses in California found a great variety of fungus among us. A review paper published March 19 in the journal Trends in Ecology and Evolution serves as a call for research in the emerging field of indoor biome ecology and evolution. The various organisms living in homes and other indoor spaces rarely has been researched, with sparse studies of rodents and German cockroaches, for example, from the pest management field, or public health perspectives on microbes. The paper came out of a 2013 workshop that included the evolutionary biology of the built environment, which included evolutionary, microbial and plant biologists, entomologists, architects, scientists who study better building design, and others. 'People have this picture that there are only a few insect species and microbial species eating human scrap,' said Laura Martin of Cornell, the paper's first author. 'But given the number of species found indoors, it is likely there's a lot more going on that we don't know about.' A study of 40 houses in North Carolina used genomic technologies to document more than 8,000 bacterial and archaeal taxa; another study of 50 houses in the same state described more than 750 types of arthropods, including insects and spiders; and an examination of 11 houses in California found a great variety of fungus among us. Researchers estimate that the indoor biome makes up about 0.5 percent of ice-free land, or about 247,000 square miles, almost the size of Texas. 'I've been noticing more species inside my house since I went to this working group,' Martin said, referring to the 2013 workshop. Co-author Robert Dunn, of North Carolina State University, discovered a species of parasitic wasp that lays its eggs inside cockroaches in his house. 'The radical diversity in abiotic environments, such as in water heaters, freezers and on kitchen counters, is vast and could parallel microclimates found on forest floors,' said Martin. The paper notes that the first human houses date back 20,000 years and that today's indoor environments most closely resemble caves. The emerging field also holds potential for studying rapid evolution, as the development of human-built environments has been recent.

Close up of a bedbug on skin.'People have this picture that there are only a few insect species and microbial species eating human scrap,' said Laura Martin, the paper's first author and a graduate student in the field of natural resources. Researchers say they have many questions regarding the indoor evolution -  such as whether species found indoors were pre-adapted to indoor environments or whether they have adapted to them; and how the indoors might drive the evolution of new species. They also hope to compare species in Alaska, for example, with species in Texas; whether outdoor environments determine what happens indoors; which indoor species are healthful to have; and how home design can contribute to health and indoor species compositions.

{"question": "A dominatrix based in Scotland is challenging a new law in Northern Ireland that will make it illegal to pay for sex. Laura Lee, 37, believes the legislation will put women's lives in danger by driving prostitution underground. In response, she's assembled a 'crack team' of legal experts to fight the legislation all the way to the European Court of Justice. For the past 18 years, Laura has earned her living as a sex worker, travelling between Scotland and Ireland and juggling the job with motherhood, studying and activism. Laura Lee, 37, has worked in the sex industry for 18 years and believes new legislation will put lives in danger . 'The work I do is very diverse,' Laura said. 'I'm a dominatrix, I provide a \"girlfriend experience\" and I also work with the disabled and terminally ill.' Laura says her clients fall into three categories. 'The first group are what I call my Duracell bunnies,' she said. 'These are the young guys who watch a lot of porn and think that good sex is just how long you can pound away for, which of course it's not. They can be difficult to deal with but they're good fun. 'I see a lot of guys in their 50s who got married at 20 and found the sex died off. It can be because they drifted apart from their wife but, in some cases, it's sadder; the wife may have developed a degenerative condition like Alzheimer's or MS or Parkinson's. 'Sometimes it's on their conscience for a long time before they contact me but they've come to the conclusion that it's better for everybody. Laura says her clients fall into three categories - including 'Duracell bunnies' who 'pound away' Until June 1, laws governing prostitution in Northern Ireland remain similar to the rest of the UK and the Republic of Ireland. This means that prostitution itself is legal, but most activities associated with it (such as soliciting in a public place or running a brothel) are illegal. Once the Human Trafficking and Exploitation Act comes into force, it will be illegal for consenting adults to pay for sex in Northern Ireland. 'The third category are my older guys. They're usually widows, terribly lonely, and they just want cuddles and company more than anything else.' Laura is careful when choosing her clients, ensuring that she's safe and that men are clear about what the session will involve, especially when they're booking her as a dominatrix. 'I get a good grasp before-hand of what they're expecting,' she said. 'We pretty much agree a scenario but part of my job as a dominatrix is encouraging people to push their boundaries. This could be through things like spanking, caning, cross-dressing or role play.' At the moment, transactions like this between Laura and her Northern Irish clients are legal. However, from June 1, a new law will mean that men who pay Laura for sex could be arrested. The legislation is being championed by Democratic Unionist peer Lord Morrow. It will make Northern Ireland the first region in the UK to ban payment for sex between consenting adults. Laura says she is a dominatrix providing a 'girlfriend experience' The so-called 'Swedish model' – which makes it illegal to buy sex, but not to sell it – has been heavily criticised by groups including the World Health Organisation and Amnesty International. They say there's no evidence it works and that, instead, it causes real harm to women. Police in Northern Ireland are not backing the legislation and the justice minister, David Ford, has said to will be hard to enforce. Importantly, a Department of Justice commissioned survey revealed that 98 per cent of sex workers are opposed to the law. 'Even women who've suffered terribly within the trade agreed that sometimes what's needed is refuge and rehab not the criminalisation of clients,' Laura said. The law is being brought in as a solution to sex trafficking, although the Department of Justice report suggested that less than 1 percent of those involved in the sex trade had been forced into it. Last year, there were no recorded incidents of sex trafficking in Northern Ireland but there were 70 recorded incidences of violence against sex workers. Laura is worried this violence is about to increase as women are forced to work in more isolated areas and clients refuse to give out personal details over fear of arrest. The main fear is of an increase in violence and vulnerability as women are forced to work in more isolated areas and clients refuse to give out personal details over fear of arrest . 'Lord Morrow has effectively said that he really couldn't care less about the welfare of sex workers,' she said. Once the law comes in, the crusading dominatrix and her team of expert lawyers will take their case first to Northern Ireland's High Court and finally to the European court of human rights. The team will challenge the legislation on several articles. They are hoping to prove that Lord Morrow's law contravenes the European Convention on Human Rights, including the rights to privacy, health and protection from degrading treatment. The law may even flout the human right to life. If prostitution becomes more hidden and dangerous, Laura has no doubt that deaths will follow. 'Sex workers are going to suffer,' she said. 'I witnessed the effects of the 1993 legislation when I was working in Dublin. As soon as legislation came in making it an offence to solicit, violence against sex workers skyrocketed and it wasn't too long before [21-year-old sex worker] Sinead Kelly was stabbed to death by a client.' Last year, a similar law was proposed in the UK by MP Fiona Mactaggart. But after a campaign by the English collective of Prostitutes (ECP), the Sex Worker Open University and the Women's Institute the bill was dropped without even going to a vote. Laura Watson of the ECP said they are behind Laura Lee's fight in Northern Ireland. 'Internationally, sex workers are challenging discriminatory prostitution laws which force us to work in isolation and increased danger,' she said. 'Legal challenges, spearheaded by sex workers, are a vital tool in our armoury to win justice and protection.'", "answer": ["Laura Lee, 37, travels between Scotland and Ireland as a sex worker .\nIt means that from June 1, men who pay for sex could be arrested .\nThe mother believes the legislation will put women's lives in danger ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "Rachel Hollis, a married mother of three, was vacationing in Mexico this weekend when she decided to do something for all the moms out there: pose in her bikini on the beach, proudly flaunting her post-pregnancy body. Hollis, 32, a Los Angeles celebrity party planner and the founder of the lifestyle website The Chic Site, on Saturday shared the snapshot on the Facebook page for her business, accompanied by a strong message of empowerment. ‘I have stretch marks and I wear a bikini. I have a belly that's permanently flabby from carrying three giant babies and I wear a bikini. My belly button is saggy... (which is something I didn't even know was possible before!!) and I wear a bikini,’ she wrote in her brief manifesto. If you got it, flaunt it: Party planner and married mother of three Rachel Hollis, 32, became a viral sensation this weekend after she posted this bold bikini photo showing off her post-pregnancy body . Proud mom: Hollis has three sons, ages 2, 6 and 8, with her husband of 11 years, David (far left) On the run: Hollis said a week before her now-famous beach photo was taken, she had completed her first marathon (left), and she felt that she was at the peak of her form . ‘I wear a bikini because I'm proud of this body and every mark on it. Those marks prove that I was blessed enough to carry my babies and that flabby tummy means I worked hard to lose what weight I could. ‘I wear a bikini because the only man who's opinion matters knows what I went through to look this way. That same man says he's never seen anything sexier than my body, marks and all. ‘They aren't scars ladies, they're stripes and you've earned them. Flaunt that body with pride!' The reaction to Hollis’ inspiring post was almost instant: by Tuesday evening it has drawn more than 341,000 'likes' and more than 10,000 comments, many of them from fellow mothers thanking Hollis for taking a stand against body-shaming and speaking out on their behalf. In an interview with Yahoo Parenting, Hollis explained that she was vacationing with her husband of 11 years, David, in Cancun when she asked him to take a picture of her in a two-piece orange and blue monogrammed swimsuit. When she took a look at the resulting image, Hollis said she noticed the stretch marks on her stomach and released that she has never seen such a candid snapshot on social media. 'So I thought, \"I'll just post this for the moms,\"' she recalled. No more shame: The 32-year-old married mother of three said she decided to share her bikini photo to give confidence to other moms . Battle of the bulge: The Oklahoma native said she has been struggling with weight her entire life . Family matters: When Hollis became pregnant with her first child, she packed on 45lbs, which she was unable to lose by her second pregnancy . Before long, comments and 'likes' began pouring in, leaving Hollis feeling overwhelmed with support. 'You have no idea of how empowering your words are to someone as myself. I gave birth to my last baby (my third son) 6 months ago. I have many stretch marks... and my confidence has plummeted. Reading this has made me realize how im seeing everything in the wrong way,' wrote Amanda Gongloff, thanking Hollis for helping her regain her lost self-confidence. Amanda Uscanga wrote in a similar vain: 'Thank you for sharing this! Finally another woman who's stomach that looks like mine.' 'Us 50 somethings are proud of our children ( and grandchildren) but ashamed of our bodies. God blessed us to bear children. The media cursed us with untrue body image. We are all beautiful because if Gods grace. My body will be in a bikini. Just bought it yesterday!’ Pam field-Mackle posted. Some of Hollis' followers went a step further, sharing on her page their own bikini snapshots, with stretch marks and all. For his eyes only: The 32-year-old party planner wrote in her Facebook manifesto that the only man whose opinion she cares about is her husband, David, and he thinks she looks sexy . Positive feedback: Hollis' photo has drawn thousands of comments from other moms, some of whom even shared 'imperfect' bikini photos of their own . Third time's the charm: after she gave birth to her third son (pictured), Hollis was finally able to get back to her pre-pregnancy weight through healthy eating and exercise . Nancy Engelhard uploaded a photo of herself in a black two-piece number on the beach, along with a caption that boldly stated: 'This is me! After 2 kids, 1 miscarriage, 7 bladder surgeries, ovarian cancer and a hysterectomy! Love my bikini! A few male commenters also weighed in, among them disabled veteran Mike Vanderveen who revealed that he still wears shorts, even though he had lost his legs in a land mine explosion. 'At least I don't have to worry about snakebites, cold feet, stubbing my toes, twisting my ankles, and buying shoes is a breeze,' he joked, before concluding in all caps: 'IF YOU DON’T LIKE WHAT YOU SEE, LOOK THE OTHER WAY!!!' Hollis responded to the veteran’s message by saying that at age 22, she had a bout with a condition called Bell's Palsy, which left her face paralyzed for two months. Not everyone, however, got on board with her positive body image message, with some users lambasting her for drawing attention to such a relatively minor problem as stretch marks. The mother of three, however, insisted that her critics missed the point of her message. Party girl: Hollis, pictured all dressed up alongside her spouse, launched her party-planning business in LA back in 2004 . Playing dress-up: The Hollis clan on Halloween, channeling an Old West town, with Rachel dressed as a flowering cactus and her youngest son dressed as a tumbleweed . Hollis, the daughter of an Oklahoma Pentecostal minister and a church pianist, said she has been fighting the battle of the bulge her entire life, even before she had her three sons, ages 2, 6 and 8. While she was pregnant with her first child, the 5-foot-2 Hollis packed on 45lbs, and she had not lost that weight by the time she became pregnant with her second son. After giving birth to her youngest, Hollis was finally able to get back to her pre-pregnancy weight through healthy eating and exercise. Hollis revealed to Today Show that the now-famous beach photo was taken a week after she had completed her first marathon and was proud of her new and improved physique. 'It’s never ever going to be like a Victoria’s Secret model, but I think I look good and my husband wants to make out with me, so I’m doing something right,' Hollis concluded.", "answer": ["Rachel Hollis, 32, a party planner from LA, took Internet by storm with her belly-bearing beach photo .\nHollis' bikini snapshots taken on Cancun beach has racked up more than 340,000 'likes' on Facebook ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "(CNN)One is a former high school cornerback who also loves baseball. The other is a football  fan who also played competitive golf. The two University of Oklahoma students at the center of a racist fraternity video have more than sports in common. They're both under fire since the nine-second clip showed them making racial slurs against blacks. In it, students at the now-disbanded Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity clap, pump their fists and laugh as they hurl racial slurs and make a reference to lynching. School officials have expelled Parker Rice and Levi Pettit because of their alleged \"leadership role\" in the racist chant. Here's what we know about the two students: . Rice, 19,  was raised in Dallas, where he recently graduated  from Jesuit College Preparatory School. In high school, he was an avid sportsman, and he played cornerback on the football team, in addition to baseball, The Dallas Morning News reported. His father, Bob Rice, is a real estate agent in Dallas, where he volunteers for various organizations, including a baseball league and the local YMCA, according to the newspaper. Earlier this year, a sibling of the younger Rice described their close relationship in an interview with their high school newspaper. In the article, the brother says they enjoy playing video games and watching movies together. Rice has apologized for the video, calling his actions wrong and reckless. \"I made a horrible mistake by joining into the singing and encouraging others to do the same,\" he said in a statement Tuesday. His family has fled their home, where protesters gathered Wednesday. They've also wiped out their social media accounts. As the university tries to heal after days of controversy, some are rallying to Rice's defense. Matthew Lopez,  a friend and fellow student at the university, said the video is not a reflection of who he is. \"That video does not represent his core personality,\" Lopez said. \"Unfortunately though, as things are, that might define him for a while. But it does not define him personally, I feel.\" Lopez described him as a \"charismatic, good person, with a good soul and a good spirit\" who experienced a lapse in judgment. \"His behavior is a result of his influence of the fraternity system and the traditions that have been embedded since pre-civil war times, when the fraternity was made, which obviously weren't the most tolerant times,\" Lopez said. The second student expelled, Pettit does not have much of a digital footprint. What appears to be his now deleted Twitter page mainly focuses on his musings about college football. Pettit played golf at his alma mater, Highland Park High School, The Dallas Morning News reported. In a statement, his parents said their son made a horrible mistake and apologized to African-Americans, students and university faculty. \"He is a good boy, but what we saw in those videos is disgusting,\" Brody and Susan Pettit said. \"While it may be difficult for those who only know Levi from the video to understand, we know his heart, and he is not a racist.\" CNN has reached out to both students but has not heard back from Rice.

{"question": "A fishing guide who was accused of hurling abuse at his clients and defecating off the front of the boat has hit back at allegations made by disgruntled customers. Manager Allan Beale of Darwin’s Barra Base has been slammed over his alleged behaviour on the Australian travel website Trip Advisor. One client, under the name ‘robrobbo’ from Brisbane has penned his fishing safari experience with Beale as ‘so bad it was great’ after staying at the lodge with four other friends in February last year. Manager Allan Beale (left) of Darwin’s Barra Base has been running his business for more than 12 years . ‘Once we hit the water with Allan I think we were all looking around for the hidden cameras!’ the post read. ‘Abused at the boat ramp whilst attempting to help him launch the boat, abused when we hooked a fish, abused when we lost a fish, witnesses to the man himself defecating off the front of the boat…’ In response to these allegations, Beale told Daily Mail Australia the review was not true and are based on ‘one side of exaggeration’. ‘The reviews were pretty rude and distorted to the facts,’ Beale said. ‘Customer service is our business. We've been in the tourism business for more than 12 years and I'm saddened to read these false allegations after all these years.' Beale said the allegation was not true and are based on ‘one side of exaggeration’ - he also added that 'catfish are a pest' so he 'assists to minimise the population' Beale said fishing safari offers a great experience to all customers as well as meet client's best interests . Beale said one person had suffered a sore back during this trip so he suggested an alternative because the man couldn't handle the rough waves and everyone was happy to choose the other location for fish species . Another client, under the name ‘Les N’ from Perth also took to the travel website to post their ‘overrated and disappointing’ experience. ‘I wrote a review on Alan's Facebook account after he used pictures of my group holding fish up that quite frankly I couldn't believe we kept?’ the post read. ‘We came here to catch sailfish & Barra? What a joke, not one sailfish and 3 barra, not one was a keeper, we paid nearly $4000 and didn't take a fish home, great.' Beale, who runs the fishing safari, said customer service plays an important role in his tourism business . A 152cm Black Jewfish landed Finniss River 17th June 2013 by Gary Bez from Karratha at head . But Beale told Daily Mail Australia they had set off for Sail City to go hunting for sailfish but one person among the group had suffered a sore back during the trip. ‘One of the chaps had a sore back and he couldn’t handle the wave action so I told them that we couldn’t go out there because we needed to look after the client’s best interest,’ Beale said. 'I like to make 100 percent of my customers happy but when it comes to bad weather and body conditions, the reality is - it’s hard to give them that because we can’t control the weather. ‘I knew the wave action from the wind would double in the next two hours and the sailfish would have been around 60 kilometres away so it was definitely out of the question. ‘I explained it to them and they accepted that they couldn’t handle the distance so I gave them two safer alternatives – go black jewfish fishing at Peron Island or travel out to Jenny and Blaze Wide for Spanish Mackerel – everyone picked the Spanish Mackerel. ‘I don’t think it’s fair to make these sorts of allegations towards our business because all we can do is offer the best service as possible.' Beale said fishing safari offers a great experience to all customers as well as meet client's best interests . Beale, who runs the fishing safari, said customer service plays an important role in his tourism business .

But Beale responded: ‘During the day clients ask questions whilst fishing about work, fishing, staff and family and their business. This comment about me moaning about staff issues just shows how little he had to go to, to complain. ‘There are issues in these allegations – they are made up and completely false. ‘And as for the defecation claims – I never defecated and they are pure lies. ‘We don’t have commercial toilets.

{"question": "(CNN)My name is Mark Goodacre, and I am a professor of New Testament and Christian origins in the Department of Religious Studies at Duke University. I was series adviser and one of many on-camera experts on CNN's \"Finding Jesus,\" which airs on Sundays. I also appear in each episode of the program. Viewers were invited to tweet and post their questions on the \"Finding Jesus\" Facebook page during the latest episode, \"The Gospel of Judas.\" Below are some of the most interesting, and my answers to them. They have been edited for style and clarity for this article: . Yalanda M. Price: What do scholars know about the man named Judas? What is his story? Mark Goodacre: Judas is actually a pretty mysterious figure in the New Testament. In fact, the relative lack of information about him in the Gospels has provided the invitation, across the centuries, for people to speculate about who he was and what could have possibly motivated him to hand Jesus over to the authorities. We know very little about his back story from the Gospels. He appears in the list of 12 disciples called by Jesus, but does not become a main character in the drama until the Passion Narratives. In John's Gospel, he is the disciple who is concerned about Mary wasting money anointing Jesus (John 12.4-6). Soon afterward, he is arranging to hand Jesus over to the authorities. His story ends with his dramatic suicide (Matthew 27.3-10), and Luke tells us that his stomach burst open and his intestines gushed out when he died (Acts 1.18-19). Mark Goodacre answers your questions about the Shroud of Turin . Kristine Spillman Adams: My understanding was always that Judas betrayed Jesus not because he was a villain, but he thought Jesus would start an earthly war when arrested. He was trying to get Jesus to establish a literal, physical kingdom on Earth. Goodacre: This is one of the great mysteries of the last week of Jesus' life. What motivated Judas to betray Jesus? John hints that it was financial greed (John 12.6), and Matthew says that he betrayed Jesus for \"thirty pieces of silver\" (Matthew 27.14-15). It is true, though, that many have speculated that Judas may have been some kind of zealot or freedom fighter, and he has often been depicted in this way in film and fiction. With this theory, he was trying to force Jesus' hand. It has sometimes been said that perhaps the word \"Iscariot\" is a corruption of the word \"sicarii,\" which means \"dagger bearer,\" and that would provide some backing to that theory. However, John identifies Judas as \"Son of Simon Iscariot\", which makes the \"sicarii\" theory less likely. In the end, we may have to accept that we simply will never know the answer to the question about Judas' motivation. Candida Moss answers your questions about John the Baptist . Betsy Wilson-Roark: Are you confident that you now have all of the pages and the current translation is accurate? Are there still words or phrases that are missing or ambiguous? Goodacre: That's a good question. Well, we probably have as much of the Gospel of Judas as we will ever have. Several additional fragments of the Codex Tchacos, in which the Gospel of Judas is featured, came to light after Bruce Ferrini, the dealer who owned the codex for some time, went bankrupt. Now, it is estimated that we have something like 90% to 95% of the text. With regards to translation and interpretation, this process will continue for years to come, as it always does with newly discovered ancient texts. I think the original translators in 2006 did a sterling job, all the more so as they were working with an incomplete, damaged and very complex Coptic text that had been lost for centuries. But I also greatly admire April DeConick's important contribution and the key adjustments in our understanding of the Gospel that this has brought about. I was delighted to see both the earlier and the newer interpretations of the Gospel of Judas dramatized so effectively in \"Finding Jesus.\" Amarylis Didley West: Is there a place that we can find and read the Gospel of Judas? Goodacre: The National Geographic website on the Gospel of Judas does feature the original translation from 2006. As far as I am aware, there is no online version of the newer edition featuring the newer fragments and the revised translation. Watch the latest episode anytime on CNNgo . NJ Robinson: Good question would be did Jesus know Judas would betray him when/before he chose him? Goodacre: The Gospel writers themselves single out Judas as the one who would betray Jesus (more accurately \"hand him over\") as soon as they introduce him (e.g. Mark 3.19), but they, of course, are writing with the benefit of hindsight. We can only guess as to what was in the mind of the historical Jesus. Our lack of knowledge about this and many other aspects in the life of the historical Jesus are what makes the story so compelling for writers of historical fiction. If you would like to read more about Judas, a good starting point is provided in this article on the Society of Biblical Literature's Bible Odyssey website.  It is written by \"Finding Jesus\" contributor Bruce Chilton. And if you would like to read more about the Gospel of Judas, \"Finding Jesus\" contributor April DeConick discusses it on Bible Odyssey.

{"question": "Peacock tails may be hard to miss, but humans are unaware of the noise created by the bird's pretty plumage. Scientists have shown that peacocks shake their tails to make a noise that is too low for us to hear. Male birds may make the infrared rumble to scare off an approaching rival or to attract a mate. Scientists have shown that peacocks shake their tails when displaying (stock image) to make a noise that is too low for us to hear. Male birds may make the infrared rumble to scare off an approaching rival or to attract a mate across dusty scrub land, the study claims . Researchers at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada, have shown that the birds make infrasound noises - below 20 hertz - using their tails and that other peacocks respond to them. Most humans hear noises between 20 and 20,000 hertz. Dr James Hare noticed a peacock displaying and shaking its tail at a wall in a zoo, which he noted looked like a satellite dish and made him question whether the bird was listening to itself, BBC Earth reported. This sparked a study, leading him and graduate student Angela Freeman to record the sound of 46 peacocks shaking their feathers while displaying. Male and female peacocks became more alert and moved around when the low noises were played back to them by researchers, with males (stock image) shrieking out . Charles Darwin first suggested that a peacock’s train serves to attract females and studies have since shown that females tend to prefer males with the most exaggerated male characteristics. Amotz Zahavi said the train indicates a male’s fitness. Males with impressive trains have been shown to be healthier, suggesting that the ornament indicates a male’s ability to survive. His ‘handicap principle’ says that since males with particularly brightly coloured or large plumes will attract the attention of predators, they must be extra fit to survive. Females are thought to choose mates with good genes, so males with more exaggerated sexual characteristics, such as a big train, tend to have better genes in a peahen’s eyes. Marion Petrie tested whether the displays signal a male’s generic quality by studying a feral population of peafowl in Whipsnade Wildlife Park in England. She found the number of eyespots in the train predicted a male's mating success and that she could manipulate a male’s chances of mating success by cutting off some of his eyespot tail feathers. In the experiment, females lost interest in pruned males and became attracted to untrimmed ones. Furthermore, chicks fathered by males with impressive trains weighed more than those sired by less ornamented birds. Humans hear a rustling sound when this happens, but the experts found that the birds hear a loud sound of between 70 and 108 decibels, according to the study published in the journal Animal Behaviour. Male and female peacocks became more alert and moved around when the low noises were played back to them by researchers, with males shrieking out in response. Experts are unsure how the birds detect infrasound, but know that some can feel vibration through their legs. Ms Freeman said that the birds may simply hear the noises through their ears, the inner part of which seems to be the right shape to detect very low noises. Other animals, such as elephants, have long been known to produce such infrasound, which humans can’t hear. And although a type of grouse called the capercaillie produces infrasound, it seemingly doesn't use it to communicate, meaning that the bird either can’t hear it itself or they just doesn't care about it. Ms Freeman believes that male peacocks may use infrasound to maintain their territory and warn off approaching rivals. But the noises could also be a way of attracting a mate. She observed that male peacocks were most likely to make the low sounds when they showed off their train feathers, producing two displays which she called the ‘shiver train’ and the ‘pulse train’. The shiver train is produced by vibration of the train feathers from the centre feathers to the outside of the array and is used by males when females are far away. Ms Freeman believes that male peacocks may use infrasound to maintain their territory and warn off approaching rivals. But the noises could also be a way of attracting a mate. Here, a male displays for a brown, female peahen, hoping she will be impressed by his show of strength . The pulse train is produced by a vibration emanating from the base of all the train feathers and it is used when the female is nearby. Peacocks’ tails are a sign of strength and good genes, so a strong noise may reinforce a message of virility, Ms Freeman said. This could be especially useful as the birds live in scrubby woodland, where high noises can only travel over short distances and birds sometimes can’t see each other. ‘We think that possibly these signals could signal to females and males who are out of sight behind a bush or over the hill,’ she added.", "answer": ["Researchers at the University of Manitoba, Canada, have shown that peacocks make infrasound noises - below 20 hertz - using their tails .\nFemales were more alert when they heard the sound and males shrieked .\nMale peacocks may use infrasound to maintain their territory .\nThey could also use the noise to attract a mate across scrubby woodland ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "Most afternoons I can be found huffing and puffing my way up Primrose Hill in North London, pushing what feels like the world's heaviest baby in a buggy. The view of the city from the top is spectacular but for a few precious days I swapped it for an even better one - with the magnificent backdrop of the Italian Dolomites. After a two-hour car journey from Innsbruck we were greeted at Rosa Alpina - a five-star, family-owned hotel and spa tucked in a valley in the tiny village of San Cassiano - with a local speciality: a sweet and comforting hot apple juice. Impossibly neat: Rosa Alpina is nestled in the green foothills of the Italian Dolomites . In the sunshine, the village looked pristine, with pretty wooden chalets stacked against mountain pastures which would have been snow-covered in winter but were now a vivid green. The grass was impossibly neat and as I wondered how many cows it must take to maintain, I spotted sit-on mowers weaving up and down the slopes. Completing the alpine scene was a hefty-looking herd with jangling cowbells. Having picked out a buggy from the hotel lobby, with map in hand we set off on a mountain walk but took the lazy way up - in a cable car. As the cable car lurched, my four month-old daughter Romilly wobbled in my lap, lip trembling; looking back down the mountain and up to the peak seemed a long way off. I began to doubt my fitness for what was my first post-baby trip away - billed as a Yummy Mummy healthy strolling break. I had feared craggy paths at the summit, precariously winding round the mountain, but found gentle, undulating trails. There was a restaurant, playground, park and fountain. It was as family friendly as the nursery department at John Lewis. Families and groups were starting out or finishing walks, with children in backpacks and buggies, or just jogging alongside their parents, perfectly content without a gadget in sight. Some were Nordic walking, others speed hiking. Would this sort of family outing happen back home? Not likely and what a shame. Instead of craggy, unforgiving trails, Sarah found undulating trails in the mountains perfect for buggies . The views were awesome and the air so pure I took in great gulps in the hope it might benefit my London-worn lungs. We could have easily taken a different trail each day of the week. At one hilltop restaurant, deckchairs overlooked the spectacular view like a sort of mountain beach, and children played on swings. For a different view of the mountains, the larch trail runs through meadows and up into the mountains opposite the hotel. It makes for a wonderful outing for energetic children (and their parents) and Rosa Alpina has produced a brilliant educational booklet which encourages little ones to look out for flora and fauna, plus answer questions on their surroundings. Sarah and her four month-old daughter Romilly enjoy the alpine views from the cable car . Tucked up inside at Rosa Alpina, the rooms were wonderfully warm - all sweet-smelling pine and herringbone fabrics - but come dusk it was far too tempting to resist lighting the wood fire. Perhaps it was the mountain air, but bedtime passed without a murmur from Romilly, who was spoilt with a beautifully made-up cot and goodie bag including baby slippers, towelling robe and a cuddly bear. Adults get treats too - of the culinary variety. Rosa Alpina boasts St Hubertus, a stunning Michelin-starred restaurant, where chef Norbert Niederkofler uses seasonal vegetables (no tomatoes in winter) and 90 per cent local produce. Romilly and I sank into a neat routine: a walk after breakfast, a swim after lunch. The peace was enough to move me to tears. For my daughter to experience so little intrusive sound apart from cockerels, cowbells and church bells was bliss. My ideal partner (apart from my partner) on the trip would have been my mother. The walks here are challenging enough to invigorate but easy enough to be a comfortable, Clare Balding-type ramble. I began to wonder if Romilly would grow up craving a life of outdoor activities, of escaping and exploring. As a quote from Fred Astaire painted on the wall of the pool said: 'Old age is like everything else - to have success in it you have to start young.'

{"question": "Killed: Jordan Brennan, 17, pictured, suffered a fatal blow to the head during a scuffle with a 16-year-old boy at a corner shop in Manchester in October . A boy who attacked and killed a teenager after interpreting his Gangnam-Style dance as 'racist' has been jailed for eight months. Jordan Brennan, 17, had broken into the dance made famous by South Korean artist Psy  at a corner shop in Gorton, Manchester. But it enraged the other boy, 16, who was shopping in the same store and thought his South East Asian ethnicity was being mocked. After claiming Jordan bumped into him as he spun round, the 16-year old attacker, who was with his girlfriend, tried to stop the victim and ordered him to apologise - but the pair became involved in a tussle. As they struggled near the doorway, Jordan fell back and hit his head on metal shutters outside the shop before his head hit the concrete floor below. The attacker then kicked him in the legs before returned to his shopping. College student Jordan got to his feet and walked home not realising he had suffered a serious head injury in the bust up. He was found lifeless in bed at 9am the following morning when his mother Kim tried to raise him for breakfast. Tests showed he had suffered a fractured skull and bleeding on the brain. At Manchester Crown Court on Friday, the killer, now 17, was jailed for eight months. The teen, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had earlier admitted manslaughter after his not guilty plea to murder was accepted. The tragedy occurred at around 7.30pm on Friday October 10 when Jordan who attended Manchester College and described as 'polite, very bubbly, happy-go-lucky type of lad' was with two friends. They went into the N.A Grocer shop on an errand but inside he began doing the Gangnam style dance and within 17 seconds there was a 'flashpoint' between him and the other teenager. Discussing the tragedy at NA Grocers, Mr Hall said CCTV in the shop captured Jordan 'dancing' in the shop before an argument took place. Weeping was audible from a public gallery packed full of Jordan's family and friends throughout prosecutor Rob Hall's opening address. He said: 'In a relatively short period of time, the defendant is in the queue at the checkout, Jordan is waiting around while others are in the check out queue and while he is waiting he proceeds to dance. 'That dance was accompanied by a reference to the well-known song Gangnam Style. 'It appears that this defendant perceived that dancing and reference as being a racist slur upon him. Jordan is of good character and so to that extent there is nothing to suggest he had racist intentions in any way. 'Needless to say that raised the defendant and he began to remonstrate about what happened. As they went to the exit door the two came into physical contact with the defendant raising his hands and pushing and pulling and in effect the physical contact put Jordan to the ground outside the exit and regrettably the back of his head made heavy contact with paving slabs outside. Jordan (pictured) fell back and hit his head on metal shutters outside the shop before his head hit the concrete floor below . Jordan Brennan had broken into the dance made famous by South Korean artist Psy whilst in high spirits at a corner shop (pictured) in Gorton, Manchester . 'Within a relatively short period of time the incident ended. The defendant was outside for 18 seconds. The whole thing lasted less than 18 seconds. 'The defendant returned back to the store to pay for his shopping and was only absent from the queue for 24 seconds which reflects how fleeting this incident was.' The court was told that the defendant, a straight-A student, had no idea he had caused any injury until he saw coverage of Jordan's death in newspapers and on TV. Jordan returned to his home which was just minutes from the shop and told his mother he was feeling unwell, it was said. The incident happened on October 10 when Jordan was with two friends . Tragically, his mother became so concerned upon his appearance and knowledge of the incident that she suggested they call an ambulance, but Jordan did not want to go to hospital. Mr Hall added: 'Jordan, being as he was, said even if his mother called an ambulance he would send it away. It is regrettable he in effect was not medically examined at the time. 'He had been sick at about midnight and again Jordan was asserting he was fine and wanted to be left alone. It is with much regret and feelings of guilt that she did not do more.' Jordan was checked on by his mother at 3.30am at which point he was sound asleep but when the family rose for the day at around 9am he was unresponsive in bed. Paramedics arrived just six minutes later but it was clear he had been dead for some time. The impact of his head hitting the pavement following the attack fractured his skull and caused bleeding on the brain. Had he been treated in hospital, he could have survived his injuries, it was said. In mitigation, Kate Blackwell QC said: 'This is a case which has led to a tragic outcome for two families. The death of Jordan was in any view devastating for his family. 'It doesn't take much to imagine for those of us who haven't lost any young family member to understand the pain and wretched loss that prevails when this happens. This case has in other ways been a terrible ordeal for the defendant and his family.' The court heard the teenager moved to the UK at the age of nine, from his native Mongolia, and excelled in his studies, receiving exemplary references from his teachers and peers which were put forward at court. She added: 'He is polite, respectful, bright, kind, with an impeccable manner. He loved school and the whole experience was grabbed by both hands. 'This was a chance encounter and his reaction to that situation was not thought by anyone to be serious and there was certainly no intention to cause serious harm and none was expected to be caused.' At Manchester Crown Court on Friday, the killer, now 17, was jailed for eight months. Pictured are floral tributes left outside the Brennan home . Sentencing him to eight months in youth custody, Judge David Stockdale said: 'Your assault on him was quite inexcusable. Your mood of aggression was demonstrated first by your pursuit of him out of the shop and by subsequently kicking him after he fell. 'You had everything going for you. But so did Jordan Brennan. A boy of 17, happy, healthy, a young boy of good character, he too had everything going for him. 'This case serves as a reminder if a reminder was necessary of the lethal consequences, unforeseeable consequences, that so often follow as a result of what might be described as low-level violence. 'Despite all of the mitigating factors I have heard and read and taken into account, I reach the conclusion that the sentence of this court must be custodial.' In a statement Jordan's mother said: 'Our son Jordan Brennan was 17 years old and was a well liked young man. He was a loveable rogue and was always polite and keen to help anyone who needed his help, be that physical help or just to listen to a friend. 'He would cheer them up with his usual larking about or joking around. He was a pleasure to have as a son and his loss is devastating.

{"question": "(CNN)Astronauts on the International Space Station completed a spacewalk Sunday despite the appearance of water inside an astronaut's helmet, NASA reported. In a tweet, the space agency said astronaut Terry Virts experienced water inside his helmet, just as he did Wednesday, but \"it's a known issue; no concern.\" The spacewalk lasted five hours and 38 minutes, NASA said. \"Crews have now spent a total of 1,171 hours and 29 minutes conducting space station assembly and maintenance during 187 spacewalks,\" the agency said in a release. NASA previously said the suit worn by NASA astronaut Virts has a history of \"sublimator water carryover.\" Water in the sublimator cooling component can condense when the suit is repressurized after a spacewalk, causing a small amount of water to push into the helmet, NASA said. NASA said International Space Station managers had \"a high degree of confidence\" in the suit. On the upcoming spacewalk, Virts and Barry Wilmore installed antennas to provide data to visiting vehicles and deploy 400 feet of cable along the edge of the station. Virts said he first noticed traces of fluid and dampness in his helmet Wednesday while he was waiting for the crew lock cabin to repressurize. He and Wilmore had been outside  the space station for nearly seven hours working on the station's robotic arm and performing some maintenance. Virts immediately alerted  fellow astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti about the water, and she alerted Mission Control in Houston. Cristoforetti helped Virts out of his helmet and examined it. She confirmed the presence of moisture, mostly in the helmet absorption pad, or HAP, describing it as \"wet and cold.\" At the request of Mission Control, Anton Shkaplerov used a syringe to draw as much water as he could from the top of the helmet.  Water had collected in the white plastic at the top and around both ear cups.  Shkaplerov estimated there was 15 milliliters of water in the helmet. That's a far cry from the amount of water that accumulated in Luca Parmitano's suit during a spacewalk in July 2013.  Between 1 and 1.5 liters of water backed up in the suit and helmet, prompting fears Parmitano could drown in his own helmet.  The spacewalk was cut short, and NASA implemented some changes to its suits, including the addition of absorbent padding in helmets. There was another intrusion of water into the helmet during another spacewalk on December 24, 2013.

So when the Tottenham manager slipped his camera phone out at Loftus Road on Saturday, you couldn’t help but notice. ‘My family was in the stands, my two sons (Maurizio, 13, and Sebastiano, 20) and my older brother (Javier). They were sitting just behind the goal in the top tier. ‘My brother is over from Argentina, he came over for the Capital One Cup final. They have the chance to go to the executive box or be in a better area but they prefer to sing the songs with the fans. So I took the photo as a souvenir. It was a fantastic moment for me and them.

Javier still works on the farm where 43-year-old Pochettino grew up in Argentina’s Murphy province. Their career paths have taken different directions but that doesn’t stop Javier providing his younger, more high-profile brother with an honest assessment. ‘He is very honest — sometimes too much! He’s six years older than me. He works on the farm and watches every game live, all the games are on in Argentina.’ Whether Javier, Maurizio and Sebastiano joined in with the Harry Kane ‘He’s one of our own’ chant is not known. They certainly had the chances to do so as two more goals took Kane’s tally to 26 for the season. He is certain to be in the England squad when Roy Hodgson, who was at Loftus Road, picks his players for the clashes against Lithuania and Italy later this month. But another ‘one of their own’, Ryan Mason, would also have impressed Hodgson. ‘Is Mason close to a call-up?

{"question": "The U.S. could face a shortage of 90,000 doctors by 2025 as it struggles to cope with an older, sicker population and increased demand from Obamacare, a new report has warned. The dire need for doctors, particularly surgeons treating diseases common among elderly people, such as cancer, was revealed by the Association of American Medical Colleges on Tuesday. 'The doctor shortage is real – it's significant – and it's particularly serious for the kind of medical care that our aging population is going to need,' said Darrell G. Kirch, CEO and president of AAMC, which represents medical schools and teaching hospitals across the country. In its 2015 report, the association found that even though the supply of doctors will increase between now and 2015, the demand for physician services will fast out-grow this supply. Struggle: A graph shows the predicted demand for doctors compared to the predicted supply between 2013 and 2015. The demand is thanks to  the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and retail clinics, among other factors . Problem: The greatest shortage will be for surgeons, particularly those treating diseases among the elderly . The  number of physicians is expected to grow by nine per cent over the next ten years, but the demand for healthcare services could grown by up to 17 percent. It predicted there could be a shortfall of between 46,100 and 90,400 doctors in 10 years' time and, of these, there could be a shortage of as many as 63,700 non-primary care physicians. This is also considering how retail clinics and outpatient centers are turning more to nurse practitioners, physician assistants and other professionals instead of physicians, the report noted. When looking at the cause behind the increased demand, the association pointed to increased life expectancy. 'An increasingly older, sicker population, as well as people living longer with chronic diseases, such as cancer, is the reason for the increased demand,' Kirch told the Washington Post. The number of people over the age of 65 will soar by 40 percent by 2025, he said. The association also noted that the implementation of the Affordable Care Act will likely increase demand. But it will do so only minimally - increasing the need for doctors by two per cent. 'The trends from these data are clear,' Kirch said in a statement. 'The physician shortage will grow over the next 10 years under every likely scenario. Demands: The Association of American Medical Colleges, which compiled the report, has called upon the government to pay to train 3,000 more physicians a year in a bid to meet the growing demand . 'Because training a doctor takes between five and 10 years, we must act now, in 2015, if we are going to avoid serious physician shortages in 2025.' He called for more efficient care and more federal support to train at least 3,000 more students a year - at an estimated cost of $1 billion a year. The association did note that the shortfalls aren't as bad as predictions in the past; in a 2010 study, they said there would be a shortage of 130,600 physicians. The difference in predictions is thanks to revised population numbers and the slight rise in doctors completing medical school. The AAMC, which is based in Washington, D.C., represents all 141 U.S. medical schools and 17 in Canada, and 400 major teaching hospitals and health systems.", "answer": ["The Association of American Medical Colleges has warned that there could be a shortfall of between 46,100 and 90,400 doctors by 2025 .\nIn particular, there will be a need for surgeons treating diseases common among elderly people, such as cancer .\nThe increased demand is due to factors including an older, sicker population and the implementation of the Affordable Care Act .\nThe AAMC called upon the government to invest $1 billion a year to train 3,000 students at medical schools ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "Jerusalem (CNN)In a sea of Jewish parties campaigning at Hebrew University, Ayman Odeh was the star attraction. But this powerful new face in Israeli politics is not Jewish. While he is an Israeli citizen, the charismatic 41-year-old lawyer is of Palestinian descent -- one of 1.6 million Israeli Arabs living in Israel. Under Odeh's leadership, Israel's tiny, splintered Arab parties have teamed up for the first time to form a slate known as the Joint List. Come election day on Tuesday, they are poised to take as many as 15 seats. This could potentially make them the third-largest party in the Knesset after Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party and his main rival, the Zionist Camp coalition, potentially giving them the balance of power. It is a game-changer, giving a significant voice to one-fifth of the population that has long complained of being treated as second-class citizens. His most immediate goal is to deny a new term to Netanyahu, who he says has led the \"most racist government in history.\" \"Netanyahu says the danger to Israel is not Palestinians in the West Bank, but rather Arabs in Israel. What is that telling me as a citizen of Haifa?\" he asked in an interview on Saturday. \"With 15 seats in the Knesset, no one will ever be able to ignore us again.\" Until now, Arab parties have failed to unite because of deep ideological differences. They run the spectrum from communist to Islamist. But a law passed by the last Knesset, sponsored by the right-wing party of Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, raised the threshold of votes a party must receive to be admitted to the Knesset. Many believed Lieberman's goal was to push the Arab parties out of the Knesset. It's a theory that was given credence when, in recent televised debate, Lieberman warned Odeh, \"You are here for now.\" \"Why are you even here?\" Leiberman said to Odeh. Baiting him by accusing him of \"representing terror groups,\" Lieberman turned to Odeh and said, \"You're not wanted here.\" Odeh politely noted that his Joint List was polling well ahead of Lieberman's party. \"I'm very wanted in my homeland,\" he said. \"I'm part of the scenery. I resemble it.\" With that calm, dignified response, Odeh attracted political star status among Jews and Arabs alike. At the Hebrew University forum, event students campaigning for the Labor Party and the left-wing Meretz Party wanted to take selfies with him. More importantly, he has given hope to the 1.6 million Palestinians who hold Israeli citizenship that they might finally enjoy social and economic equality. In the Wadi Nisnas neighborhood of Haifa where Odeh grew up, the shopkeepers and restaurant owners welcome him as a native son. Odeh goes door to door with the ease of a natural politician, speaking about the importance of turning out to vote to ensure the Joint List gets enough seats to change the face of the Israeli government. Over hummus and stuffed vegetables, he speaks about a 10-year plan to close the social gaps between Israel's Jews and its Arab population, speaking about issues such as education, housing, employment for women, public transportation in Arab towns and recognition of unrecognized Bedouin communities in the Negev. Growing up, he says he identified with Malcolm X. But as he got older, he began to feel he should follow in the footsteps of Martin Luther King Jr. With a large block in parliament, Odeh says he would have a greater platform to press for better treatment of Palestinians in the occupied territories and to speak out about the need for a Palestinian state living beside Israel. \"What makes people vote is the hope of change,\" he said. \"We have been ceding hope again and again. But we are 20% of the population. We can prevent the right from forming a government.\" There is some skepticism here that Arabs will finally have a say in how the government is run, but most are hopeful. Sitting on a stoop chopping celery stalks for the grocery store across the street, Sami Abuliat says Odeh is a good spokesman for Palestinians living inside Israel. \"We've asked for so many rights we don't we won't get,\" Abuilat says. \"The big eat the small. But united, we can be strong. This is a good first step.\" If, as many expect, Likud or Labor fail to strike deals with smaller parties to get the 61 seats needed to form a government, they may be forced to join together in a \"national unity\" government. That would make the next biggest group of parties, and Odeh, the official opposition. It's a position he says he would prefer over joining an Israeli government, which he says dedicates a large chunk of its budget to policies that discriminate against the Palestinians. The Prime Minister is required to brief the leader of the opposition at least once a month on diplomatic and security matters. Odeh would be entitled to a seat on Israel's foreign affairs committee in the Knesset and is obligated to address the Knesset after every speech by the Prime Minister. He would also protected by the Shin Bet security service. He would have the ear of foreign leaders, who would reach out and meet with him to hear his views. Odeh says he needs the help of Israeli Jews, who he hopes one day will become a greater voice in the cause of social justice for all Israelis. \"Arabs alone cannot make a democracy strong. It has to be Arabs and Jews,\" he says. \"My dream is one day we will build a real Arab-Jew party, and I tell Jews to come join us and build a true democratic party in this country.\" It's a message that resonates back at Hebrew University, where some Jewish students are joining the fight against what they call institutional discrimination in Israel. \"It is not only a struggle of the Palestinian minority living in Israel. It is the struggle of the Palestinian minority together with democratic Jews like myself,\" says Ofer, a student with the Jewish communist Hadash party. It's not a vision shared by most in Israel, but Odeh's message to students is \"this is your chance.\" By finding their voice and using their vote, he says, they can make the dream of equality a reality.", "answer": ["Ayman Odeh is a new face in politics: He is an Israeli citizen and a charismatic lawyer of Palestinian descent .\nUnder Odeh's leadership, Israel's tiny, splintered Arab parties have teamed up .\nThey are poised to take as many as 15 seats in the Knesset ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "It is a common problem for airlines, ferries and cruise ships - how do you make passengers pay attention to the safety briefing? Condor Ferries believes it has found the solution, producing a video complete with a rapping captain and dancing staff that certainly attracts attention. Doing away with the monotone yet informative messages usually portrayed in safety briefings, the Portsmouth-based company said it wanted to inject some 'fun' into this year's offering. But not everybody is a fan, with some commentators saying they would prefer to jump overboard than listen to the song. The captain introduces the rap for a very different safety demonstration . Condor Ferries have produced the safety rap as part of their 'Good Times' branding . Slightly out of sync and with some incredibly cringeworthy dance moves, the video seems to have done the trick and has already been viewed nearly 20,000 times since it was posted on YouTube several days ago. The video begins with a captain sporting blue sunglasses and some questionable moves as he announces: 'To ensure you have good times on board, please listen up to the following safety message from Condor Ferries.' It's soon time for the crew to get involved as they raise their hands in the air singing, 'life jackets, life jackets, they're right beneath your seat.' The pair then instruct those watching how to operate the life jacket. 'It clips together so easily just listen for the click,' sings the female. 'That means you've done it properly and you look so very hip.' That may be a matter of opinion. The steward raps how to fix the life jacket on and blow the whistle, all out of sync . All you have to do is just 'listen for the click' says the stewardess, and that means you've done it right . The male then takes the lead when notifying of where the emergency exits are, complete with some cringeworthy dance moves that involve bouncing on the spot and hilarious hand signals. But it only gets worse. It's back to the captain, as he comes into shot singing 'now ladies, hey ladies,' while making what can only be described as an 'uncomfortable' facial expression. However, rather than flirting, he is simply advising that 'sharp objects can't go on our slides, so leave those heels behind.' The steward then bounces on the spot and uses amusing hand gestures to warn of the emergency exits . The emergency slide is then shown, at least in graphic form, as the stewardess demonstrates how, well, to slide down it. The video then uses graphics to show how the staff can help passengers from wheeling their luggage, to using a resuscitator and defibrillator, as 'you name it, we have it.' The star of the show then comes back, the captain, as he sings: 'So who would have thought that the Condor could bust out such good rhymes?' The video is being broadcast  on all sailings between Poole and the Channel Islands. He's back! The captain then makes a somewhat unnerving re-appearance as he warns ladies not use heels down the emergency slides . The idea was conceived and produced by Bournemouth-based Walker Agency, working closely with the Condor Ferries safety, marine operations and marketing teams. Alicia Andrews, executive director – commercial at Condor Ferries, said: 'We're really proud of the new safety video, it's been a very fun project to work on, and we're delighted with the results. 'Our brief was simple, we wanted something a little bit different, something that our passengers would sit up and take notice of, and which would appeal to all members of the family. We think that the rap, with the Good Times messaging does just that. The stewardess demonstrates how passengers would use the emergency slide... not too difficult . 'Ferry travel is very family-friendly, there are no restrictions on the amount of luggage you can bring – you can pack everything in to your car, and off you go. 'We hope that our passengers, whether they are frequent travellers or joining us for the first time this summer will enjoy the video and their Good Times experience onboard Condor Liberation as we set sail to Jersey and Guernsey.' However the video has been met with less-than positive comments by users on YouTube, where it has been hosted. The staff are there to help with passengers' every need, according to the safety video . Liam Gilheany wrote: 'I want to pour lava into my ears,' while James Lund added: 'I'd want to jump into the harbour if this is for real.' Nathan Thomas is somewhat dubious as to the authenticity of the captain writing: 'I hope they keep a look out for fishing boats better - now they seem to have employed a stripper as a captain.' Condor are believed to be the first ferry operator to produce an onboard safety video to feature a rap. The release has coincided with the launch of its brand new state-of-the-art Condor Liberation with a new mission statement of 'Good Times.' The video has been met with pleasure by senior executives at Condor Ferries .", "answer": ["Hilarious and out-of-sync video shows a captain and two members of staff .\nTrio run through the safety aspects of ferry travel with a 'rap'\nVideo has been ridiculed by  viewers online, with one saying they would 'jump in the harbour if this is for real'\nIs part of Condor's new #GoodTimes campaign and branding exercise ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "The former ACT chief minister has revealed a long-term, exhausting battle with anorexia, which saw her weight dwindle to a mere 30 kilograms. The 59-year-old has announced her teenage struggles at a function on Monday and has shared that she still has to have little discussions with herself about body image and naturally thinks she is too fat. Now the head of the Australian Chamber of Commerce, Ms. Carnell has recalled beginning to lose weight at 12 or 13 years old when a teenage interest in boys and fashion sparked. The head of the Australia Chamber of Commerce announced her continuing struggles at a function on Monday . She said she felt rotten about herself and what she was doing to others in her life. 'I was stick thin but people said 'wow you are looking so great.' I wasn't - I was looking really skinny,' she told ABC television. 'It is hard to understand why you can't put a piece of food in your mouth, chew it up and swallow it. How hard can that be. When you've got anorexia it's like moving a mountain,' she said. The ABC reported that Ms Carnell was in and out of hospitals in her home town of Brisbane during the 1960s and 70s and was lying to her parents about what she was eating and the amount of exercise she was doing. The battle with anorexia began when she was 12 or 13 and she gained an interest in boys and fashion . Her battle she has seen her weight dwindle to just 30 kilograms and saw her in and out of hospitals . When 15-years-old, she was sent to an adolescent psychiatric facility at Prince Henry Hospital in Sydney when the situation became severe. 'For a 15-year-old away from home it was to say the least pretty scary,' she said. She said her parents were only allowed to visit occasionally and she was incredibly homesick. 'Imagine a scenario when you've got a teenage daughter who's always been a bit of an overachiever, pretty smart — and all of a sudden they're killing themselves in front of your eyes,' she said. Ms. Carnell outlined these experiences at a function where the advocacy group The Butterfly Foundation released a report that outlined the high cost of treating eating disorders that affected almost a million Australians. The chairman of the Butterfly Foundation, David Murray said their report from Deloitte focuses on the economic cost of the problem and the large benefits of intervention. 'Early intervention pays big time, with about a 50 per cent cost reduction for the government in the health system by getting the problem early enough,' he said.

{"question": "Happy: Abbi Jillians has been given a pink hand through the pioneering 3D printer technology . The first thing four-year-old Abbi Jillians wanted to do when scientists gave her a new hand was brush her Barbie doll’s hair. The youngster – who was born with a just a thumb on her left hand – has been given the pink hand through the pioneering 3D printer technology. She has now been using her new hand to pick up objects around her house, ride her bike, and even pinch her dad on the bottom. Full-time mum Julie Jillians, of Tavistock, Devon, started a campaign to find local access to a 3D printer three months ago and said the new hand had revolutionised her daughter’s life. The 47-year-old said: ‘When we got home, the first thing she did was pick up her dolly so she could brush her hair with two hands. ‘That is one thing she always wanted to do. She had always loved her dolls and wanted to dress them - but I ended up always having to do it for her. ‘It is amazing and wonderful to see her do it herself. She is just like any other girl - Barbie is her favourite. ‘This is just so special for Abbi. The smile on my daughter’s face is from ear to ear with a bow round the back. ‘I am now finding things all over the house. There are apples upstairs. She’s even managed to pinch her daddy’s bum. ‘It’s fantastic. The determination on her face is the sweetest thing, and the fact she’s willing to receive the hand and willing to work at learning to use it.’ The hand works by opening and closing when Abbi bends her wrist up or down. It has a Velcro which straps around her palm and the gauntlet sits on her arm. Abbi had an operation at 18 months old, taking parts of her toes to give her a bigger palm, and replacing the toes with hip bone. But her mother said she and husband Jim, 34, would not consider any more operations after seeing the success of her hand. She said: ‘It is fantastic and we just can’t stop her using it. She wants to wear it all the time and cannot believe what she has now got. New lease: Julie Jillians says the pink hand has changed Abbi's life and the four-year-old has been testing out the new kit by picking things up and putting them down all over the house . Abbi's hand costs around £50 in materials to print a hand, so new limbs can be created as she grows . ‘She is still building up her strength and getting used to it - and she cannot hold anything too heavy. ‘But she is going around picking everything up, from cups to fruit, and playing with all the toys she was never able to before. ’She loves dress-up as well and is finding that a lot easier now she has two hands. Abbi's hand is among designs available on a global database of 3D printer prosthetics and comes in 30 colours. It was printed in around 20 pieces which were put together with elastic bands before a professional helped to fit it. The hand is attached to Abbi’s arm with Velcro straps. She can control it by twisting her wrist to tighten the bands. The 3D printer was provided by IT firm Midwich, and the Enabling The Future website printed it out and helped fit it. A Midwich spokesman said NHS prosthetics were usually for aesthetic purposes only and did not move or grip. He added that it costs around £50 in materials to print a hand, so new limbs can be created as a child grows. ‘She was never able to ride a bike before as her hands would slip off the handlebars. But she is now riding it around the house. ‘The technology is fantastic. The more she gets to use it, the stronger her wrist and arm will become. There is no way I would consider another operation for her now - this is just way too functional. ‘Because her muscles aren’t as developed in that arm, we keep having to take it off her so she doesn’t overdo it. But in time the muscles will get stronger and she’ll be able to use it more and more. ‘It’s not going to be a permanent fixture on her arm but it’s there as and when she needs two hands.’ Abbi, who is in reception class at school, said of her new hand: ‘I love wearing it so much. I want to wear it forever and ever.’ Mrs Jillians launched the appeal for organisations with a 3D printer to help Abbi, and the FabLab at Plymouth College of Art, with the help of IT firm Midwitch, came forward. The family has since raised nearly £4,000 to get a nearby school kitted out with a 3D printer to help other children in a similar position to Abbi.", "answer": ["Abbi Jillians, 4, was born with just a thumb on her left hand .\nShe now has a pink prosthetic hand through 3D printer tech .\nIt costs £50 to print, so new limbs can be created as she grows ."], "label": "SUM"}

'We get the organisation before the game from the manager and the assistant manager before the game, so I'm not too sure who makes the final call.' What Baines was confident about was that the defending wasn't good enough. 'There's shades of the goal we conceded against Arsenal as well,' he added.

{"question": "Ireland narrowly missed out on reaching the quarter-finals of the Cricket World Cup as they fell to a seven-wicket loss against Pakistan. William Porterfield had earlier struck his maiden World Cup century and Ireland were indebted to their captain as his 107 helped them post a modest 237 all out. However, the 30-year-old was outshone by Sarfraz Ahmed, whose unbeaten 101 led Pakistan through to the next stage of competition on net run-rate.

Thursday, March 19 - India v Bangladesh - Melbourne . Friday, March 20 - Australia v Pakistan - Adelaide . Saturday, March 21 - New Zealand v West Indies - Wellington . The sides’ had contrasting starts to the competition and it was associate side Ireland that began the better of the two; with victories over the West Indies and the UAE. Pakistan however, were on the end of heavy defeats against bitter rivals India and the West Indies and were facing increasing scrutiny over whether they were going to be able to seriously contend at this World Cup. But with the competition geared towards ensuring the ‘top-eight’ teams make it through to the knockout stages of the competition, all the sides knew even as little three wins could see a team advance. In hindsight the turning point in the tournament for Ireland came against South Africa, against whom they suffered a mammoth 201-run loss. The match obliterated their net run-rate. Ireland's Ed Joyce takes a catch to dismiss Pakistan's Shehzad for 63 runs . John Mooney of Ireland stands in the outfield as they attempted to beat Pakistan in Pool B . Meanwhile, Misbah-ul-Haq, Pakistan’s effervescent and immovable captain was slowly ensuring he continued to carry his side back to some respectability. A shock 29-run (D/L) victory over South Africa ensured the match against Ireland would be a straight knockout, after the West Indies guaranteed their safe passage to the quarter-finals with an easy victory against the UAE earlier in the day. Porterfield decided having runs on the board would be his side’s best chance of victory against the 1992 World Cup champions, having won the toss. Admittedly the Adelaide Oval pitch did look every bit the ‘batting paradise’ Shahid Afradi called it and despite missing their leader with the ball Mohammad Irfan, Pakistan had Ireland in all sorts of trouble early on. Paul Stirling went for three to World Cup debutant Ehsan Adil as he tried to play across the line and was trapped lbw. Despite surviving an early scare after being dropped by Shehzad on five, Ed Joyce failed to make the most of his reprieve as he top-edged a Wahab Riaz delivery to Umar Akmal at short square cover on 11.

Pakistani players celebrate getting the wicket of William Porterfield of Ireland . Umar, relieved of his keeping duties in the previous match against South Africa, seemed rejuvenated and went on to become the joint-record holder with four catches as a fielder. But Ireland’s innings centered around their captain who, in what may well be Ireland’s final World Cup match, played some of his best cricket of the tournament as he made his hundred. As many batsmen do, Poterfield rode his luck – including being dropped on 99 by keeper Sarfraz and he scurried through for his century. It took an impressive catch from Afridi to finally dismiss the Irish captain for 107 off the economical Sohail Khan. The equation for Pakistan was simple, win or tie against Ireland and they would be through and Sarfraz and Shehzad’s 120-run first wicket partnership took them a large way towards their target. Though Shehzad (63) and Haris Sohail (3) fell in quick succession, Misbah steadied the ship and while the Pakistan captain ended up being dismissed in the most peculiar way - as he stood so far back to an Alex Cusack delivery that he tread on his stumps, Pakistan never looked in trouble. Porterfield (left) is congratulated by Ireland team-mate Wilson after reaching 100 runs . Ehsan Adil (centre) celebrates  after successfully appealing for LBW to dismiss Ireland's Paul Stirling . Although it was a comfortable victory, the end was slightly marred by Sarfraz’s insistence in obtaining his own personal milestone and rather than opting to take singles with Umar, he waited for the opportunity to clear the field. Had Ireland amassed a few more runs that dangerous strategy could have led a more serious issue for Pakistan. Ireland may be returning home earlier then they has hoped at the beginning of the day but they will at least be able to do so in the knowledge that they defeated more Test playing nations than England. It’s unlikely to be of much comfort to the associate side with their future in the competition unknown but Ireland along with the other associate sides – Scotland, Afghanistan and the UAE – showed in the past four weeks that the World Cup will truly miss them if the ICC has its way.

{"question": "This is the moment a tearful Chinese mother and her two daughters knelt down to beg forgiveness from the parents of a student who died while saving the two girls' lives. The youngsters, aged seven and nine, had gone with their mother Li Xiaoli at the end of last month to visit a man-made lake near the village of Xizhaolou in Qingfeng county, in central China's Henan province. But as they were playing on the side of the lake, the younger of the girls - named Chao - slipped and started to fall towards the water, and when her sister Liao went to grab her, she fell in as well. Li Xiaoli and her two daughters beg the parents of the man who died saving them for forgiveness . Meng Ruipeng drowned after rescuing the two girls pictured, but their mother failed to report it for fear of a compensation claim . Both girls were wearing winter coats and it was clear they would not survive long as they struggled to get back to the shore. The girl's mother, who was unable to swim herself, started screaming, alerting a nearby university student named Meng Ruipeng who ran over to help. Without thinking of his own safety, Meng jumped into the water to rescue the girls, The People's Daily reported. He managed to throw the youngest girl from the steep-sided quarry lake back onto the bank, plucking her from below the surface where she had started to sink, and then pushed the older girl towards the bank where she was grabbed by her mother and pulled to safety. Meng Ruipeng (pictured), 24, died dragging two young girls to safety from a man-made lake . But the intense cold and exertion had left the 24-year-old student so weakened that he sank below the surface seconds later and vanished from sight. Yet incredibly, instead of raising the alarm, the girls' mother had been terrified that she would end up in trouble and possibly a compensation claim from the boy's family, and had told the girls to say nothing. Instead, she had taken them home, dried them and changed their clothes, and acted as if nothing had happened. However, she did not realise that the drama had been watched by fishermen on the other side, who had raised the alarm with police. After divers investigated, they recovered the young man's body, and then started trying to work out if other people were involved in his death. That eventually led them to the girls and their mother Li Xiaoli, who had initially denied knowing anything about the tragedy but later admitted what she had done. So as the young man was being prepared for the funeral, she and her daughters turned up dressed in black together with all their savings, a total of 10,000RMB (£1,000), and offered it to the parents of the dead student to make amends. She said: 'I forced my girls to say nothing, it was my decision, and all the shame is mine. 'I offer you my apology and my tribute to your son who saved the lives of my two daughters.' After seeing the two children in tears alongside the mother, the parents of the dead boy accepted the apology. They also told them to keep the money, saying it would not bring back their son but their admission of what he had done at least restored honour to his death. Mourners lay wreaths at the funeral of 24-year-old student Meng Ruipeng, whose body was found by police . Mr Ruipeng's parents forgave the mother of the two girls and declined her offer of £1,000, saying her apology was enough to restore honour to their son's name .", "answer": ["Mother begs for forgiveness after failing to report man's death after rescue .\nMeng Ruipeng, 24, jumped into freezing cold water to save two girls' lives .\nBut exertion and freezing temperatures drained his energy and he drowned .\nThe girls' mother, fearful of a compensation claim, failed to report it .\nBut she appeared at his funeral in tears to beg his parents for forgiveness ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "(CNN)The end of \"Jinx,\" the six-part HBO documentary about real estate heir Robert Durst, has launched a debate about whether some potentially incriminating statements Durst made while in the bathroom to a microphone may be used in his criminal prosecution. Durst, as you probably heard, is charged with murder in a killing in California 15 years ago, and he has been suspected, but never charged, in the disappearance of his first wife in New York. Whether or not the taped words of an accused person will be admissible against him involves a look at the rules of evidence and the Constitution, as well as our fast-evolving ideas about privacy. While Durst's attorneys can make a number of arguments to suppress these statements and bar their admission at trial, the bathroom confessions will likely be factored in. Let's go over three main reasons why: . 1. Is this inadmissible hearsay? Probably not. Hearsay is defined as a statement made outside of court that is offered in court for its truth. It really just means a witness can't testify at trial about someone else's version of the facts. If a sentence starts with \"He told me\" or \"She said that,\" it's probably hearsay.  As general proposition, hearsay is supposed to be inadmissible, but the exceptions nearly swallow the rule itself -- so much so that many commentators have suggested abolishment of the exception-riddled rule itself. Perhaps the largest and best known category of hearsay exceptions is admissions and confessions. These can be admitted against a defendant. Why?  Well, the idea is that these statements are reliable. The thinking is that people don't ordinarily confess to something unless they did it. 2. Is this a violation of Durst's constitutional privilege against self-incrimination? Again, probably not. The rules of the U.S. Constitution are a different matter. The Fifth Amendment's self-incrimination clause states that \"[n]o person ... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself ...\" By definition then, compulsory self-incrimination requires, well, \"compulsion.\"  And not just any compulsion. The kind of compulsion targeted by the Fifth Amendment is governmental coercion. Durst may still contend that his \"confession\" wasn't voluntary.  It's true that confessions deemed \"involuntary\" are often excluded at trial under the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment.  However, a confession will only be considered involuntary if it is the product of police activity. Voluntariness is not an issue when admissions are made to a private person, such as a journalist. What of Durst's likely claim that the filmmakers were essentially acting as an arm of the police?  Sometimes law enforcement exercises so much control over a civilian that his private actions become police action, constitutionally speaking. This is not an easy case for a defendant to make, though.  Durst would have to establish that the HBO interviewers were direct agents of the police and that the interview was coerced by police. The police undoubtedly benefited from the work of these citizen documentarians.  But the police frequently benefit from the work of good Samaritans or citizens volunteering information, photos or iPhone videos.  The television show \"America's Most Wanted\" has been premised on this idea for decades.  Given the defendant's burden here, it's unlikely that he can convince a judge that, in light of all the circumstances, filmmakers acted as an instrument or agent of police. The bottom line is this: A voluntary confession must be the product of a rational intellect and a free will, not physical intimidation or psychological pressure. How was Durst \"pressured\" when alone in the bathroom?  However, his attorneys might argue that some mental impairment rendered him incapable of the necessary rational intellect and free will. 3. Can Durst argue for some \"reasonable expectation of privacy\" that was violated by his being taped in the bathroom? Not in our modern world, and not in this case. Perhaps in decades past, a court might be offended at an audio recording of someone in the bathroom, but things have changed. Subjects of documentaries and reality TV stars alike routinely sign contracts allowing camera crews to pin a microphone to their lapels and follow them around 24 hours a day.  Moreover, everyone in the television news business has a story about some famous correspondent going to the bathroom and forgetting about their \"hot\" mic.  In this brave new media world, the rule appears to be: You wear a lavalier microphone at your own risk. This is why defense attorneys tell clients to not give interviews.  No matter how good an interviewee a client may be, audio and video editors have an uncanny knack for isolating the less than flattering sound bites.  Admitting to killing \"them all\" would fall into this category. When it comes to giving interviews, it's probably better for defendants such as Durst to keep silent and be thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt, especially doubt of the reasonable kind.", "answer": ["Robert Durst made some potentially incriminating statements at the end of HBO's \"Jinx\"\nDanny Cevallos: Durst's attorneys will want to bar their admission at trial, but they will likely be factored in ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "A video has emerged believed to show ISIS executioner Jihadi John ranting on camera shortly after he arrived in Syria from the UK. The footage is of two bands of fanatical fighters joining forces in 2013 under the command of notorious terrorist Omar al-Shishani. At the front stands a man thought to be Mohammed Emwazi - the west Londoner last week unmasked as the killer of Western hostages in a series of videos which have shocked the world. A man thought to be Jihadi John proclaims allegiance to a terror group in footage filmed in 2013. The video is thought to be the first known appearance by the executioner now unmasked as Mohammed Emwazi . The video is thought to have been filmed  just months after Emwazi is understood to have fled Britain to take up arms alongside the extremists. It shows a pledge of allegiance made when the so-called 'Army of Muhammad Brigades' group joined forces with the so-called 'Brigade of Migrants', of which Emwazi is believed to have been a member. The speaker proclaims: 'This army announces unity within its ranks for the sake of implementing the Shariah and returning this blessed land to God the most glorified and the most high under the leadership of the emir Umar al-Shishani.' Emwazi, now 26, attempted to join al-Shabaab in Somalia after finishing his university course in London in 2009, but was refused entry to Tanzania and  returned to Britain, from where he later went to Syria. He is thought to have been in a group who were among the first to go to fight in the Middle East, along with fellow Londoners Ibrahim al-Mazwagi, Choukri Ellekhlifi and Mohammad el-Araj. Ellekhlifi was two years above Emwazi in his north London school, Quinton Kynaston Academy, and later became part of a robbery gang which carried out a series of raids in central London. Ellekhlifi, 22, fled to Syria while on bail and was killed fighting near Aleppo in August 2013, months after the video thought to feature Emwazi was filmed. El-Araj, 23, was killed two weeks later during a firefight. Al-Mazwagi, from North London was 21 when he was killed in Syria in February last year. Emwazi was last week unmasked as the killer who carried as series of beheadings of Western hostages . In the film, the man thought to be Emwazi stands in front of notorious terror leader Omar al-Shishani (right) Emwazi's links to the London crime gang meant he had developed a love of violence, which led to him being chosen to feature in the beheading videos for which is now known throughout the world. In the latest video, the man suspected of being Emwazi stands at the front of a long line of gun-toting militants, with al-Shishani standing behind him arm-in-arm with two other fighters. Commenting on the likenesses of Emwazi to the speaking in the latest video to emerge, Raffaello Pantucci of the Royal United Service Institute told MailOnline: 'Given he’s masked, it is difficult to make the precise connection between the two, though there are definite similarities. 'Given the group and community that Emwazi came from – the West London group - were all alongside the Katiba al Muhajireen under Omar al Shishani, it might well fit that it could be Emwazi. 'Given his solid Arabic and his willingness to be front and centre in films, it would fit that it could be him. Al Shishani seems to have been quite willing to record films of himself with his foreign fighter warriors.' Charles Winter from the Quilliam Foundation added: 'There are certainly similarities between Emwazi and the man speaking in this video, the eyebrows for example. 'In terms of the group, we know that it has a large proportion of foreign fighters so there's a possibility that he could have joined but I'm unable to say whether it is definitely him. The video shows a pledge of allegiance to Omar al-Shishani, now a commander of ISIS in Syria . Emwazi is thought to a fighter (second right beneath flag) who appears in another photo featuring al-Shishani . Mr Winter added: 'While he does have certain features that resemble Emwazi, there have been numerous false alarms with ID-ing \"Jihadi John\" in the past. A balaclava does a lot to obscure one's face, and a lot to make people look similar, too.' Others have cast doubt on whether the man is Emwazi, saying the speaker in the film looks shorter than the Londoner and appears to be holding the Kalashnikov rifle with his right hand, whereas Jihadi John held his knife in his left hand. If the video does show Emwazi, the footage would be the first known time he appeared on camera in Syria after going to fight. It is believed he was one of more than 700 fighters in The Migrants Brigade who arrived in the Middle East three years ago. The group were not part of ISIS at the time the video was filmed, but joined the group in the months that followed. Emwazi has since become one the world's most wanted men after he appeared in a series of gruesome videos beheading a series of foreign hostages, including British aid workers Alan Henning and David Haines and US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff. Mohammed Emwazi is believed to have among a group of Brits, which also includes Ibrahim al-Mazwagi (left), Choukri Ellekhlifi (centre) and Mohammad el-Araj (right), who were among the first to travel to Syria to fight . Ibrahim al-Mazwagi (centre), the first British jihadi known to have died in Syria, is pictured here with Abu Omar al-Shishani (right), one of the most feared military commanders of the Islamic State of Syria and Iraq . Omar al-Shishani has  moved from the conflicts of the Caucasus, south of Russia to become one of the most feared commanders in the ISIS army now terrorising Syria and Iraq . Omar al-Shishani, whose real name is Tarkhan Batirashvili, is an ethnic Chechen from the Caucasus nation of Georgia, specifically from the Pankisi Valley, a centre of Georgia's Chechen community and once a stronghold for militants. He fought in the brief conflict between Russia and Georgia in 2008 and became a jihadist after being discharged from the Georgian military on health grounds after contracting tuberculosis. After recuperating and being refused re-enlistment, he was arrested for stockpiling weapons and jailed in September 2010. Following his release, he travelled to Istanbul in Turkey in March 2012 to join Chechen rebels in the Syrian conflict. The red-bearded fanatic became the commander of the Brigade of Migrants, which was initially aligned with al-Qaeda's Jabhat al-Nusra. The group merged with other jihadists in March 2013 to form the Army of Emigrants and Supporters, a larger and more structured group with a religious council. In May 2013, Shishani switched to supporting the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and has become the group's military commander in Syria, leading it on an offensive to take over a broad stretch of territory leading to the Iraq border.

'Someone so small has left a massive hole that can never be filled, but he will always be remembered for his cheeky, fun-loving nature and we are grateful to have had him in our lives, albeit for such a short time.' A book of condolence has since been opened at Landscore Primary School where Samuel was a pupil. Gary Read, the school's headteacher, said: 'Samuel was a truly decent young boy - honest, attentive, generous, loyal and kind. 'To be taken from his family and friends in this way feels incomprehensible.' Hundreds of people also attended a candle lit vigil at Holy Cross Church on Monday in memory of the youngster. Reverend Nigel Guthrie, Rector of Crediton, said: 'We wanted to give people a chance to express their feelings about what happened to Samuel. Samuel was walking to meet a friend in Crediton, Devon (pictured) when the collision occurred. Cameron Trivett, 24, has been charged with causing death by careless driving and failing to stop after a collision . 'It's a huge shock to the whole community as the family are so well-known and loved. 'There has been a very large response and we hope it can help bring everyone together in the wake of it.' The Bishop of Crediton, Rt. Reverend Nick McKinnel, added: 'This is terribly sad news and my heart goes out to the family of this young boy and to his friends at school.' Terry Keen, who lives next-door to the Crocker family, also paid tribute. He said: 'They are a wonderful, local family who have lived here for some time. He was a terrific young boy. 'We would often see him playing out the back, practising his basketball. He was getting very good at it. 'He went to Landscore School with his older brother. We do not know much about what happened.' Devon and Cornwall Police confirmed the coroner had been informed of the death.

{"question": "Women are grossly underrepresented in professional football, both in terms of TV coverage of female games and in the number of women working in the male section of the sport. Those that do venture into men's football are often subjected to regular abuse - according to the campaign group Women In Football, two thirds of females working in the industry have been on the receiving end of sexual harassment. So a female lineswoman who was filmed talking back to the Ponte Preta footballer Biro Biro during the Campeonato Paulista match on Sunday has been heralded a hero by fellow members of her sex. Scroll down for video . Tatiane approaches Ponte Preta footballer Biro Biro to argue back against a criticism he had about one of her decisions . During the match between Sao Paulo and Ponte Preta, lineswoman Tatiane Sacilotti is seen to signal a throw-in. But Biro Biro is not happy with the decision and heads over to Tatiane to give her a dressing down. Unimpressed with the attack, Tatiane takes it upon herself to follow Biro back down the pitch, arguing back furiously. Shocked by the comeback, Biro then walks off with a wave of his hand, so Tatiane heads back to her post with a fuming backwards glance. The clip has since been shared hundreds of times on social network sites. @CANNCDavis wrote on Twitter 'Looool Tatiane Sacilotti has made my day she was not having it.' Another said: 'Brazilian lineswoman puts abusive player back in his box.' Tatiane is furious as she follows Biro Biro up the pitch . As Biro Biro is shocked into heading back onto the pitch, Tatiane heads back to her post, shooting a glowering look back at her opponent . It isn't the first time in recent years that a lineswoman has been headline news. In January 2011, TV commentators Andy Gray and Richard Keys, who apparently believed their microphones were switched off, were recorded making disparaging remarks about Sian Massey, 25, before Liverpool’s Premiership clash with Wolves. Commenting on Ms Massey, Mr Keys said: ‘Somebody better get down there and explain offside to her.’ Mr Gray, a former Scottish international footballer, replied: ‘Can you believe that? A female linesman. Women don’t know the offside rule.’ Mr Keys replied: ‘Course they don’t. I can guarantee you there will be a big one today. 'Kenny (Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish) will go potty. This isn’t the first time, is it? Didn’t we have one before?’ Gray’s contract was immediately terminated by Sky Sports' managing director Barney Francis for unacceptable behaviour, while Keys resigned soon after. Name: Tatiane Sacilotti Dos Santos Camargo . Born: Brazil, February 10, 1986 . Age: 29 . Job title: Assistant referee . Tatiana faced much abuse during her junior years as a referee, including being spat at by fans. By 2011, she had graduated to the premier league in Brazil though, where she has stayed ever since. Tatiana's dream is to work up the career ladder at FIFA and her idol is the Brazilian referee Luis Flavio de Oliveira. To substitute her income as a referee, Tatiane has launched a pancake delivery service with her mother Antoinette called House of Pancake, which sells 29 different recipes. The family, who are descended from Italians, run the company together - Tatiane and her mother make the pancakes and her father and brother deliver the produce. When she is not busy with one of her jobs, Tatiane is deeply religious and regularly attends church in Cachoeira. She also exercises daily with a personal trainer, where she does circuit training and runs eight km. Speaking of her parents' reaction to her training as a referee, she told refnews.com: 'She supported me at the time. 'My mother does not even like football but she watches all of my games and requires complete silence in the room and bites her nails. 'She gets mad when they say I messed up, but she does not know whether it was right or wrong. 'Her support has been very good.' Although she is well respected in the game, Tatiane continues to suffer abuse from men in the game occasionally. During one incident in 2013, a footballer complained about one of her decisions and assaulted her. Tatiane said: 'He complained much of a marking mine. 'I asked him to calm down and put a hand on his chest. 'Then he slapped me, but it was light, not reported to the referee.'", "answer": ["Tatiane Sacilotti was working a match between Sao Paulo and Ponte Preta .\nBrazilian lineswoman was abused by footballer Biro Biro for a decision .\nBut she chased the Preta star down the pitch and argued back ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "Juventus travel to face Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday night knowing that if they do not score, their German opponents can knock them out with a single goal. So the message is clear: they must attack. Head coach Massimiliano Allegri has spoken out ahead of the game urging his team to show they are far from the side cast as 'boring' that lead Italy's Serie A - and the Italian sport newspapers have reflected the boss' vision. La Gazzetta dello Sport, Tuttosport and Corriere dello Sport all call for the nation's champions to attack Dortmund, with a forward line including Marco Reus and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang unlikely to be restricted to an extent that they are unable to score the one goal that could send Dortmund through after Juve's 2-1 home win last month. La Gazzetta dello Sport's: 'Go Juve! The right choice' and Tuttosport's: 'The order of Allegri: Let's attack!' Corriere dello Sport's front page barks out: 'Juve, take Europe' after Massimiliano Allegri's comments . Tuttosport's message is the most resounding, with their front page specifically calling for Juve to attack at the Signal Iduna Park making it clear that in order to qualify, the Old Lady need goals. The paper also calls for Argentine winger Roberto Pereyra to be used in a 4-3-1-2 system by Allegri - who it also reports is set to be offered a new contract. Both Gazzetta and Corriere look to Juventus' talisman, former Manchester City and Manchester United striker, Carlos Tevez. Gazzetta also want to see Pereyra deployed in a 4-3-1-2 behind Tevez and Alvaro Morata in a game that could be worth £6.5million to Juve. Carlos Tevez trains ahead of the last-16 tie, and the Italian papers see him as a key man for Juventus . Paul Pogba takes a moment away from the training session as Juventus look to hold on to their lead . Meanwhile, Corriere calls for the 'class of Tevez and super defence to tackle Klopp'. 'We go into the game with an advantage,' Allegri said ahead of the game. 'We know the difficulties of the task ahead of us, no doubt about it. 'I don't expect it to end 0-0. We need to score at least once and if we could score two goals it would be great.' Allegri believes the game in Dortmund will not end 0-0 and that his side will need to find a way to score . Alvaro Morata hits a pass during training, and Gazzetta dello Sport want him upfront alongside Tevez . The Germans have been improving in recent weeks after a bad first half to the Bundesliga season and have lost none of their last six league games. They are also unbeaten at home in Europe this season although they have lost all three previous encounters against the Italians in Dortmund. 'We have to be ready for the strengths of Dortmund, their speed, their pressure,' the Italian coach added. 'We have to have a technically perfect game and pounce on their weaknesses.'

{"question": "Jerusalem (CNN)A newly released ISIS video shows a child shooting a man the group claims is an Israeli spy. The video identifies the man as 19-year-old Mohamed Said Ismail Musallam, an Israeli citizen of Palestinian descent. In the video, ISIS shows Musallam's Israeli passport and claims he's an agent sent to infiltrate the group. The 19-year-old's family told CNN Tuesday that he had no ties with the Mossad, Israel's spy agency, and had, in fact, been recruited by ISIS. \"Mohamed told me and his brother that ISIS took him,\" according to Said Musallam, his father. \"They sent him money through the Western Union. They said you will have girls, money, cars, villas, paradise, but afterwords he discovered that there is nothing.\" It wasn't long before Musallam's family members didn't recognize him when they talked to him on Skype. The man they knew as a kind and funny brother and son who was once a volunteer firefighter had grown a long beard and was carrying a rifle. His father tried to help him get home, sending him money and even enlisting the Red Cross. But his son never made it back to Israel. About a month ago, Said Musallam said, he was told his son was taken by ISIS when he was on his way back and trying to cross the border. A video posted Tuesday on ISIS-affiliated social media accounts shows a man who appears to be Musallam on his knees, wearing an orange jumpsuit. An adult ISIS fighter and a child -- both in fatigues -- stand behind him. The adult, speaking French, gives a command to the child to go forward with the killing. The child steps in front of the man and raises what appears to be a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and shoots Musallam in the forehead. The man immediately falls forward to the ground. The child appears to then fire at least two more shots into the body. Ahmad Musallam said he'd seen the video of his brother and was devastated by his death. \"I used to take care of him and babysit him when Mom went to work,\" he said, crying. \"Mohamed is not a brother. He is a son.\" But he refuses to show the video to his parents, who still can't believe their son is dead. An issue last month of ISIS' English-language propaganda magazine, Dabiq, included a purported interview with Musallam and described his alleged work for the Israeli spy agency. In the ISIS video, Musallam seems to be reading what appears to be a prepared confession, saying he is an Israeli intelligence agent working for Mossad, sent to infiltrate ISIS. Musallam's family members said they believe he was coerced in the video, forced to lie about ties to Israeli intelligence. \"Mohamed is not an agent. Mohamed  doesn't have a shekel. If he was an agent he would have lived a beautiful life,\" his mother, Hind Musallam, said. \"We could have been living a different life and I would not be working cleaning houses so we can live.\" This isn't the first time ISIS has used children to drive home its message. An ISIS propaganda video released in January -- one that CNN could not independently verify -- shows a boy with a pistol apparently shooting two men in the back of the head. The boy then stands over one of the bodies, fires two more times, and later raises his pistol high. Last August, a photo posted to Twitter from an ISIS stronghold showed a 7-year-old boy holding a man's severed head and his father's words, \"That's my boy.\" ISIS has featured children as fighters before, calling them the \"cubs of the caliphate\" (the adult jihadis call each other \"lions\") and has encouraged foreign fighters to bring their families. It has taken over schools to indoctrinate children. Human Rights Watch says ISIS and other extremist groups \"have specifically recruited children through free schooling campaigns that include weapons training and have given them dangerous tasks, including suicide bombing missions.\" CNN's Stefan Simons, Cynde Strand, Ben Wedeman, Kevin Flower, Catherine E. Shoichet, Faith Karimi, Greg Botelho and Jessica King contributed to this report.", "answer": ["A video claims to show the killing of Mohamed Said Ismail Musallam .\nMusallam's family says ISIS recruited him .\nISIS claims the 19-year-old is an Israeli spy ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "She's as well-known for her stunning figure as she is for her chart-topping hits so it's perhaps no surprise that American songstress Taylor Swift is reported to be insuring her legs for a cool £26.5million. Grammy-winning Taylor, 25, attributes a huge slice of her global success to her energetic stage performances and her team have apparently looked into how much it would cost to insure her legs against potential career-threatening accidents. The Pennsylvania-raised star is embarking upon a global tour in May and the move is said to be a precaution against such a physically-demanding schedule. Scroll down for video . Diamonds in those heels: Taylor Swift's super-slim legs have reportedly been insured for a whopping £26.5million ahead of her gruelling world tour which begins in May . Prized assets: Taylor's pins, on display (left) at the Saturday Night Live anniversary special last month, are considered a key part of her high-energy stage performances. Showing them off at a pre-Grammy Gala in LA in February (right) The Blank Space singer is reported to have said she was 'embarrassed' at how much her slender limbs are said to be worth. Celebrity insurers Lloyd's, which has specialised in offering body-part policies since the 1930s, said they were not surprised by the vast sums attributed to Taylor's pins. Underwriter Jonathan Thomas told FEMAIL: 'Taylor Swift’s income-generating capacity is hugely dependent upon her stage presence and thus her exceptional legs are indeed very likely worth millions of dollars of insurance.' She's certainly not the first celebrity to insure herself, however, with a whole host of other stars on record for ensuring their prize assets, which they often consider the key to their success, are protected by policy. Long before Kim Kardashian's derriere arrived on the scene, Jennifer Lopez famously insured her perfectly-round bottom for millions of dollars. Australian singer Kylie Minogue, whose rear grabbed the headlines in gold hotpants in the video for hit single Spinning Around back in 2000 was said to have insured her behind shortly after to the tune of £3million. That booty! J-Lo (left) was the original doyenne of the derriere and is said to have a £17million premium protecting her bottom. Kylie Minogue (right) has a similar policy, worth £3million . Dolly Parton is as well-known for her 40DD chest as she is for her back-catalogue of country music hits and is alleged to have once insured them for £3.8million - or £1.9million each. Bruce Springsteen's relentless live dates contribute hugely to his overall fortune so he needs more than the price of honey and lemon to keep his voice safe - the vocal chords of 'the Boss' are covered for up to £3million. For obvious reasons, sports stars can also have high premiums attached to certain parts of their anatomies. Although it's common practice for football clubs to insure against injury, a career-threatening tackle on a higher-profile star could potentially lose the club millions in sponsorship deals. In 2006, it was revealed that David Beckham had insured his cross-whipping legs against injury for around £100million while playing for Paris Saint-Germain. While in 2013, Portuguese star Cristiano Ronaldo's club Real Madrid renewed their insurance for his lightning-quick legs at a cost estimated to be around £74million. Legs eleven: When David Beckham was competing at a professional level, his goal-scoring limbs had a whopping £100million price tag on them. The Boss, aka Bruce Springsteen, is so protective of his lucrative voice that he's insured it for £3million . No need for a stuntman: 007 star Daniel Craig insisted on doing many of his own action scenes in the 2008 Bond film Quantam of Solace...at a cost of £5million in insurance . In 2008, Daniel Craig insisted on doing many of his own stunts for Bond film Quantam of Solace. 'He does a lot more than Pierce used to do,' said the film's chief stunt coordinator Gary Powell at the time, '...and he's allowed to because he's capable of doing it. He thinks, \"You're paying to see me, and that's me doing it.\" He wants the audience to know.' It might have given the film's makers a headache though, for such daredevilry came at an eye-watering insurance price, said to be £5million. A head for business: The Only Way is Essex star Joey said last year that he would insure his perfectly coiffured hair for £1million...shortly after launching his D:Reem range of hair products for Tesco . Good golly, Miss Dolly: Country star Ms Parton has protected her surgically-enhanced bosom for £3.8million while trailing in her wake is reality tv star Holly Madison, who has a similar chest-protecting policy for £66,000 . Million-dollar smile, literally. Film actress Julia Roberts was the subject of an insurance policy that saw her pearly whites covered for just shy of £20million . Becoming savvy about protecting career-boosting parts of the body isn't a new phenomenon. As early as the 1930s celebrities became aware of how much certain bits of them can influence their success. Specialist insurers Lloyd’s say the entertainment industry developing in California in the early 20th century quickly appreciated just how much a film could gross if its central star's appearance was just right. Early film stars such as Cyd Charisse’s (legs) and Jimmy Durante (nose) chose the company to provide them with policies. Present-day clients include  burlesque star Holly Madison’s breasts and NFL player Troy Polamalu’s hair.", "answer": ["The Blank Space singer is said to be 'embarrassed' by hefty insurance sum .\nThe star's team are protecting her prized assets ahead of world tour .\nOther celebrities who've famously insured parts of their anatomy include David Beckham (legs), Bruce Springsteen (voice) and Dolly Parton (chest)"], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "The charity race at Cheltenham is supposed to be all about the taking part - except when serial winners Sir Alex Ferguson and multi-champion trainer Paul Nicholls are involved. Co-owner Fergie and Nicholls were so keen for the Ditcheat trainer’s head lad Clifford Baker to ride the winner that his fancied mount Rainy City, who cost £100,000, had exploited the grey areas of eligibility for the last race on the Festival card yesterday. The regulations, confirmed by a Cheltenham spokeswoman, state that horses in the line-up should all have been given an average BHA rating to ensure a competitive race. Sir Alex Ferguson (right) and Paul Nicholls (left) were at Cheltenham to watch Rainy City finish fifth . Yet Rainy City, who is highly thought of in the Nicholls yard, had no BHA rating, and rival jockeys were concerned that Fergie’s horse was far superior to the rest of the field. The get-out clause buried in the fine print was that any horse without a rating could be handicapped by Cheltenham at their discretion. In the event, Rainy City finished an outpaced fifth, having led for most of the 1m 5f. Nicholls said: ‘Of course we wanted to win. But it’s a charity race and we entered to give Clifford a ride.’ Arena Racing Company, who own racecourses that stage 40 per cent of UK fixtures, still chose to hold their annual drinks party during Cheltenham, even though it is not one of their tracks. ARC are owned by the Reuben brothers, the billionaire property developers who have caused serious upset by closing down popular racecourse Hereford and moving its meetings to the over-raced Chepstow and Uttoxeter tracks. Hereford is now empty most of the time as part of a long-term property play between the local council and the Reuben brothers, who are never seen at the races. Arena Racing Company were among many companies hosting their annual drinks at Cheltenham . It doesn’t say much for the commitment to developing homegrown cricket talent that England selector Mike Newell, in his other role as Nottinghamshire’s director of cricket, has signed Zimbabwe batsman Brendan Taylor as a Kolpak player. The 29-year-old has played 23 Tests and 166 ODIs. The move follows another England selector, Middlesex boss Angus Fraser, bringing in New Zealander James Franklin on an Irish passport. Minister for Sport Helen Grant is a guest of the British Horseracing Authority and Jockey Club at Cheltenham today. But Grant, a modest drinker, is unlikely to embrace the liquid Festival hospitality as heartily as one of her predecessors did last year. The former minister was barely able to walk through the car parks after the meeting. Minister for Sport Helen Grant, a modest drinker, is unlikely to end up like a predecessor at Cheltenham . LTA back in fat cat mode . LTA chief executive Michael Downey has yet to justify an annual salary and benefits package of £434,000 plus a massive one-off relocation payment of £190,000. Nor did the Canadian do his image much good by wearing a GB tracksuit top during last weekend’s Davis Cup triumph over the USA in Glasgow — a cardinal sin for a sports administrator. LTA chairman David Gregson had said Downey would receive a £300,000 salary on his appointment but it seems the excesses of the Roger Draper regime are already in danger of being repeated. LTA chief executive Michael Downey was not his usual suited self in Glasgow - he wore a GB tracksuit top . There will be only five more racing days after Saturday before Clare Balding turns her back on presenting the sport following Royal Ascot. But the Balding effect has not boosted Channel 4’s viewing figures — quite the reverse. The Cheltenham peak of 996,000 was down again on Wednesday, year on year, by 20,000. And the last time Cheltenham enjoyed four consecutive days of 1m-plus ratings was pre-Balding in 2012, when Highflyer produced the coverage and John McCririck, John Francome and Derek Thompson were all still on board.

{"question": "It’s a privilege reserved for a lucky few but now experts have revealed exactly who is getting on board when it comes to private jets. The spotlight has been shone on the industry's latest marketing statistics - identifying Americans as the most frequent flyers while the busiest route is between Moscow and Nice. Billionaire entrepreneurs, chief executives and A-list celebrities are amongst the exclusive clientele, found to be 80 per cent men. Top ten: Aviation experts NetJets, which has the largest private jet fleet in the world, has listed its top ten routes with passengers . High flyers: A NetJets Europe Phenom Jet 300 comes in to land at London City Airport. London features in three of the top 10 flights . Aviation provider NetJets - which has the largest private jet fleet in the world - announced the findings of the annual report for 2013. Users of the luxury crafts, which often boast private bedrooms, fine-dining facilities and the odd cinema, are typically private entrepreneurs, aged between 40 and 55. The aircraft provider said the United States remains the world’s leading private jet market with 60 per cent of global traffic starting and ending there. Popular routes include Moscow to Côte d’Azur, Miami to New York, New York to Los Angeles, New York to West Palm Beach and London to New York in the most recent data.

Aviation data found flyers are often private entrepreneurs . Lap of luxury: The inside a Global 6000 reveals why those who can afford it are increasingly turning to the pricey form of transport . Europe has the second-largest market for those wanting to avoid the queues, with about a quarter of the US, with Russia representing a significant portion of overall European demand. But Marine Eugene, executive director for NetJets Europe, said the United States was way out in front when it came to private air traffic. 1. Moscow - Nice/Côte d’Azur . 2. Miami - New York . 3.

Houston – Midland (Texas) 8. Lagos - London . 9. Austin - Houston . 10. Houston – Washington . She said US businessman were more inclined to use the private transportation as they were 'driven by access' with huge expanses to be covered, often requiring more than one connection. 'If you are a very busy businessman having to connect between flights for meetings, it can be difficult to get where you need to go and at a time you need to be there,' she said. 'In the US there are no business flights and you really don't have the service that you would expect if you are a very busy person. 'With private flights, you can decide what time you want to set off and arrive, at a time that suits the individual and their business needs.'

No toy: Often seen as a play thing of the rich and the famous like John Travolta pictured, private jets are now regarded as vital business tool . Popular destination: London ranks highly with private jet passengers, according to research by aviation experts NetJets . Elsewhere, private air traffic between London and New York continues to increase year on year with the UK capital accounting for a third of the most frequented routes. Within London, London City Airport has seen significant increases traffic over the last year. The airport is seen as an important hub, particularly for those that work in the financial sector, given its close proximity to Canary Wharf and the city in general. Dubai and the broader UAE are seeing growing traffic although the Middle East’s position as the world’s third-largest market is being challenged by the rise of traffic in China and Brazil. The data showed traffic from Brazil to Europe has grown by a fifth each year since 2010 with the UK, France, Spain and Portugal amongst the most popular destinations. The total business jet market in China still below Europe, estimated at 20,000 flights per year, with potential for significant growth predicted in its domestic flights. Nigeria has also become one of the fastest growing hubs with private departures to and from Lagos. Experts have put the steady global rise down to more travelers rating the plush transport as a vital business tool. Industry figures claim the flights are often cost effective for businessmen, giving them the swift access needed to close deals, often worth huge sums of money. The ability to get anywhere, at any time, can be priceless when it comes to the limited leisure time most customers experience.

{"question": "Michael Carrick has credited the return to form which has seen him recalled to the England squad down to the influence of Manchester United manager Louis Van Gaal. The midfielder, hailed by Sir Alex Ferguson last year as the best English player in the game, has won countless club trophies but struggled for consistency at international level throughout his career. Now 33 years old, he is one of the oldest heads in Roy Hodgson’s squad and is a strong contender for a place at the bottom of the midfield diamond the England manager so often prefers to deploy. Michael Carrick is happy to be back in the England squad and has credited his return to Louis van Gaal . Carrick had particular praise for the Manchester United manager's aura and straightforward nature . ‘Van Gaal has improved me,’ Carrick said. ‘Certain situations in games, he's helped, not just individually but as a unit, as a defensive unit, as a group of players. I've definitely learnt from him. ‘He's been great from the start for me. I couldn't ask for any more from him in terms of what he's given me, and the support and confidence to be a big part of the team. ‘A lot of people at the top of their field, whether it's business or sport, tend to have that aura, and he's certainly got that belief and clarity in what he wants and what he expects from players. 'He's really straightforward and honest. ‘What you guys see when he speaks publicly, he's exactly the same with us. He's straight down the line and honest and says it exactly as it is.’ Van Gaal puts an arm around Carrick after they helped United to victory against Liverpool at Anfield . Carrick says he couldn't ask for any more from Van Gaal in terms of support and confidence he has given . Carrick is still yearning to improve his game further, despite moving into the twilight of his career, and tries to learn from the very best in his role. ‘You can look at a few – Andrea Pirlo, Xabi Alonso, Sergio Busquets,’ he said. ‘Busquets probably doesn’t get enough credit for what he brings to Barcelona. There’re a few out there. ‘I thought Marco Verratti and Thiago Motta for Paris Saint-Germain against Chelsea were terrific, especially when they went down to 10 men. I like watching and still trying to learn from others.’ Carrick has also gained his footballing education alongside one of the midfield masters in Paul Scholes, and their former United team-mate and England coach Gary Neville compared the pair to ‘going into a bar and hearing a piano playing’ due to the calm they brought to the midfield together. Andrea Pirlo was the first name mentioned by Carrick in terms of midfielders around Europe he looks up to . Xabi Alonso (right) was also mentioned, as well as Sergio Busquets in midfielder for Barcelona . Carrick felt Marco Verratti (bottom) did a brilliant job for Paris Saint-Germain against Chelsea in Europe . ‘It made me laugh,’ Carrick said. ‘I can see Nev saying that, but it was quite nice in a way. Playing alongside Scholesy I learned so much. He’d take the ball anywhere, he’d put his foot on the ball and try to have influence on the game. ‘It is a lot about your personality, as a person, as a player, that is how I am really, quite quiet and understated, it suits me.’ Gary Neville (centre) compared Carrick's calmness to ‘going into a bar and hearing a piano playing’ Carrick has become a key part of United's side as they look to secure a place in the Premier League top four .

Sociedad were the only La Liga side without a win on the road this season going into Monday's clash at the Coliseum Alfonso Perez, but they finally got that monkey off their backs courtesy of Inigo Martinez's second-half header. The Sociedad academy product rose highest to nod home Esteban Granero's accurate free-kick off a post in the 66th minute, although Getafe keeper Vicente Guaita will be disappointed at not being able to stop it.

Victory takes Sociedad up to 10th, level on 33 points with ninth-placed Espanyol, while Getafe remain 13th. Moyes' side, who like Getafe came into this game on the back of two wins and a defeat in their last three matches, saw plenty of ball early on but did little with it. The hosts looked sluggish during the opening exchanges, but they had a penalty appeal turned down in the ninth minute. Pedro Leon cut into the box and just as he looked to get it out of his feet and pull the trigger he was stopped in his tracks by a bumbling challenge from Sociedad centre-back Martinez. Referee Melero Lopez waved away the appeals, but the incident sparked Getafe into life and Quique Flores' side should have taken the lead when Alvaro Vazquez beat three defenders and then disappointingly toe-poked straight at Sociedad's grateful keeper Geronimo Rulli. Leon came within inches of opening the scoring after 20 minutes when he exquisitely curled onto the bar from the corner of the box.

Gonzalo Castro (right) and Getafe's defender Alexis Ruano battle for the ball during the Monday night clash . Moyes shakes hands with Getafe's head coach Pablo Franco ahead of the La Liga encounter . Rulli was beaten all ends up as the ambitious shot sailed over his head and he - as well as everyone else - no doubt expected it to miss the target comfortably, but a deceptive dip saw it drop down sharply and clip the frame of the goal. Imanol Agirretxe had a few headed chances as Sociedad began to show more in the final third, but Leon went close with a wicked shot from distance before Diego Castro was bravely thwarted by Rulli in a goalmouth scramble as it remained 0-0 at the interval. Sergio Canales starred as Sociedad upped the tempo in the second half, first rounding three defenders and then forcing a good save out of Guaita, before desperate defending blocked his goal-bound shot from hitting an empty net in the 57th minute. Martinez made the pressure count by leaping highest to head Granero's pinpoint free-kick in with the help of a post as Guaita got close to clawing it away after it bounced off his right upright, but fell just short of getting a good enough contact. With Getafe frustrations boiling over after the goal, Juan Rodriguez protested too loudly when his penalty appeal for a challenge by Martinez and Granero was rejected and he was duly booked by Lopez. The hosts frantically probed for an equaliser late on, with Mehdi Lacen again forcing Rulli into another good save with six minutes remaining, but Sociedad held out to finally get a reward on their travels.", "answer": ["Real Sociedad were the only La Liga side without a victory on the road .\nBut Inigo Martinez's second-half goal secured three points for the visitors .\nDavid Moyes' side are 10th, level on points with ninth-placed Espanyol ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "Ryan LaFlare faces one of the toughest challenges of his unbeaten career as he takes on perhaps the most decorated Brazilian jiu jitsu practitioner ever to grace the Octagon in Demian Maia. Maia proved against welterweight title challenger Rory MacDonald last year that once he takes control from the top, there is no way out. But while New Yorker La Flare acknowledges the tough test that lies ahead, he believes he will hold the advantage in the striking and wrestling departments.

Veteran fighter Maia (left), pictured fighting Alexander Yakovlev, will pose a real threat to LaFlare's record . 'The guy is one of the top guys in the world, you know, of course he's good,' he told Sportsmail. 'I'm just a little better. I think that his striking is maybe a little more basic for me. 'I think I have a little bit more of an awkward, outside of the box approach to it and I think that that's something I can use. A lot of his wrestling is pretty basic and I've been wrestling my whole life, so that's another thing I can use.' Having been out of action for nearly a year after being struck down with a bone infection last August, Maia is reporting a clean bill of health ahead of the contest and the submission specialist is looking to impress his countrymen in Rio. 'I am very proud to be here in Brazil again,' he said. 'I'm very happy with the opportunity the UFC has given me, to fight a main event here in Rio de Janeiro, a city I love - especially returning from an injury. I am 100 per cent now, I feel much stronger than I felt in my past camps.' Maia poses duriong the UFC Fight Night weigh ins at Maracanazinho earlier on Friday . And when it comes to LaFlare's 11-0 record, which includes four consecutive wins under the UFC banner, Maia knows that he will have to be on top form to put the first blemish on the American's clean record. 'I will need to want to win the fight a lot more than he wants to,' he added. 'Because I know he has a lot of will power, but I need to have more than him.' Despite other fighters citing their reluctance to face off against a Brazilian opponent on their home turf, LaFlare believes that the crowd will offer Maia no advantage once the Octagon door shuts. 'I don't think it makes any difference to me. Once the Octagon doors are shut, it's just me and him in the cage,' he said. 'Some people could think differently but, for me, it's just me and him – just another day in the office.'

{"question": "(CNN)While Boston and other New England cities have suffered through their snowiest seasons, other parts of the country have some unexpected good news to go along with the record-breaking winter conditions. All that cold air and a stuck weather pattern are keeping tornadoes to historic lows so far this year. March is typically a transitional month, where warm moist air from the Gulf of Mexico collides with cold Arctic air to produce severe thunderstorms and tornadoes. This year, however, the jet stream pattern responsible for all the cold air and snow in the East remains stuck in more of a winter mode. \"We're in a persistent pattern that suppresses severe weather, and the right ingredients -- moisture, instability and lift -- (have yet to come together),\" said Greg Carbin, the Warning Coordination Meteorologist with the Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. The group is responsible for issuing the tornado and severe thunderstorm watches that warn the public of impending severe weather. So far this year it's been extremely quiet. By this time in mid-March the center would have issued 52 tornado watches nationwide. This year they have issued a paltry four. Both January and February were well below normal. March has been even quieter.  At a time where the tornado season usually ramps up considerably, there has not been a single report this month of a tornado. \"We are in uncharted territory with respect to the lack of severe weather\" Carbin said. In fact if we make it through the entire month of March without any tornado reports it would be a first, according to the center. There have been around 20 tornadoes reported since January 1, well below the 10-year average of 130 for the period from the beginning of the year until mid-March. This year comes on the heels of what was has been a welcome lull of tornadoes across the United States the past several years.  In 2014, we ended the year with a count of 881, well below the average of 1,253. Meteorologists don't fully understand why we have seen the recent drop in tornadoes, but one possible answer is the development of El Nino, a warming in the equatorial Pacific, which can influence weather patterns globally. Recent studies point to lower tornado counts in the United States during these events. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently said that a weak El Nino had developed. So while all agree this is good news so far this year, it is clear that it is no guarantee that the rest of the season will remain this quiet. Weather patterns can change quickly. In 1984, for instance, there was a very similar slow start through mid-March and the number of tornadoes ended up well above average by the end of June, according to data from the storm center. It's also important to note that even in years where the tornado counts are low, you can still have very violent tornadoes -- 2013 being a perfect example. The year ended being roughly 30% below normal for the number of tornadoes, yet included some of the strongest tornadoes on record. The twisters in Moore and El Reno, Oklahoma, occurred in May of that year with devastating results.

{"question": "Assuming Northern Ireland don’t now stumble on the road to France, they will owe a big debt of thanks to their big No 10 for firing his country to a major championships for the first time in 30 years. Not since the 1986 World Cup have the Northern Irish graced a big stage. Indeed, they have never qualified for the finals of the European Championships. But after Kyle Lafferty scored twice against Finland at Windsor Park to take his total in qualifying to five goals in five games, Michael O’Neill’s side will never have a better chance as they remain one point behind leaders Romania following their fourth win of the campaign. Northern Ireland striker Kyle Lafferty celebrates after scoring against Group F rivals Finland at Windsor Park . Lafferty scores past Finland goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky to open the scoring at Windsor Park in Belfast . The Northern Ireland striker leaped above Finland's defence to double the scoreline just five minutes after his opener .

Star man: Kyle Lafferty . Northern Ireland remain just one point behind Group F leaders Romania . The two countries meet here in June when Northern Ireland will have a great opportunity to go top. Even if it all goes wrong, this result puts them eight points clear of fourth-placed Finland and almost guaranteed of at least a playoff place. ‘We’re in a really strong position, there’s no doubt about that,’ said O’Neill. ‘Will 18 points be enough? Possibly. But Belfast in June is as far as we’re looking ahead.’ Finland simply couldn’t handle Lafferty, the 6ft 4in striker on loan to Turkish club Caykur Rizespor from Norwich after a frustrating spell at Carrow Road, who made life as difficult for them as possible in the blustery conditions. He had already caused central defenders Joona Toivio and Niklas Moisander plenty of problems before putting Northern Ireland in command with two classy finishes in the space of six minutes. The first goal came from a freekick after Lafferty was fouled by an exasperated Moisander in the 33rd minute. Finland cleared Oliver Norwood’s inswinging free-kick but Niall McGinn nodded the ball back to Lafferty 15 yards from goal and he showed fantastic technique to turn and volley it beyond goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky and into the far corner. Ireland looked most dangerous down their right-hand side and when Jamie Ward and Conor McLaughlin combined once again in the 38th minute, Lafferty met Conor McLaughlin’s pin-point cross with a glancing header into the bottom corner. Lafferty celebrates with his Northern Ireland team-mates during his side's 2-1 Euro 2016 qualifier against Finland . Premier League stars such as Jonny Evans (centre left on back row) and Chris Brunt (centre right on back row) started for Northern Ireland . It was no surprise to see Toivio hooked at half-time in favour of the more muscular Paulus Arajuuri – ‘a tactical substitution,’ was the curt response from Finland boss Mixu Paatelainen afterwards – or Lafferty receive a standing ovation when he was replaced by Josh Magennis 11 minutes from time. He is now second only to David Healy in the list of Ireland’s all-time leading goalscorers. ‘Kyle was outstanding again and he scored two fantastic goals,’ added O’Neill. ‘He’s going on the pitch believing he’s capable of scoring every time he plays. ‘It’s a little bit like the David Healy situation where things at club level aren’t going as well as he would like. But he’s showing what he’s capable of against top-class European defenders.’ Finland substitute Berat Sadik pulled a goal back in the first of three minutes of added time to set up an unnecessarily nervy finish, but Ireland held on and the celebrations told their own story.

{"question": "According to some accounts, the wealth of the ancient Roman empire was reflected in the very fabric of the city - with buildings of sparkling white marble at its centre. Even the founder of the Roman empire, Emperor Augustus claimed that he had 'found Rome a city of bricks and left it a city of marble'. But new research by historians at the University of California Los Angeles has now cast doubt on this boast. Scroll down to explore ancient Rome in 3D . This reconstruction by historians at the University of California shows how Rome would have looked under the rule of Augustus and reveals that many of the buildings were made from brick (shown in grey) while only a few temples were constructed from marble (pink) Using architectural computer modelling software they have been able to reconstruct the entire city to reveal how it would have looked during the rule of Augustus between 44BC and 14AD. The Pantheon, Trajan's Market and the Colosseum have remained standing for nearly 2,000 years. Scientists claim to have found a 'secret' ingredient in Roman concrete that helped it endure the elements. Using X ray beams at the Advanced Light Source (ALS), researchers were able to study a reproduction of Roman volcanic ash-lime mortar. In the concrete walls of Trajan's Markets, constructed around 110 CE, this mortar binds cobble-sized fragments of tuff and brick. Scientists looked at the mineralogical changes that took place in the curing of the mortar over a period of 180 days and compared the results to 1,900 year old samples of the original. The team discovered that the volcanic ash creates a crystal structure that prevents tiny cracks from spreading. They also found that the use of strätlingite crystals in the material showed no corrosion, with their smooth surface suggesting stability. They found that in fact only a small proportion of the buildings in Rome at the time were converted from brick into marble. Indeed, the few buildings that were built from marble were hidden from view within the city landscape, meaning many historical discriptions of the city's beauty were perhaps exaggerated. Their discovery suggests that the claim attributed to Augustus may have been more of a metaphor than a literal boast. Dr Diana Favro, who led the work, said: 'Many scholars have looked at Augustus’ claim from a political standpoint, as a metaphor for him transforming a republic into an empire. 'I wanted to see if Rome literally transformed under his rule. Given the literary descriptions and artwork, I thought these glittering marble temples on high would be very visible, but they were not.' Dr Favro used information from archaeological and historical records to produce the computer model that can show how the city evolved during Emperor Augustus' rule. Buildings constructed from marble were shaded with pink while those that were made from brick were shaded brown. Those under construction were yellow. When the researchers examined the model, they found just a few buildings were clad with marble, including the Temple of Venus and the Basilica Julia. Dr Favro found that when viewed from the street level, however, these buildings were not widely visible. Shortly before Augustus came to power, the Carrara marble quarries on the northwest coast of Italy were opened, and this was thought to have made marble a popular building material. Augustus commissioned several large marble structures, some of which took 40 years to complete. As a result, massive marble blocks were constantly being moved through the city, causing congestion in the streets. Marble-paved public spaces, which used to only be found in sacred temples and houses of the elite, were also added throughout the city. The 3D model (above) allows researchers to explore the city down to the street level and see how it changed between 44BC and 14AD . The Basilica Julia in the Roman Forum was one of the few buildings to be constructed from marble in Rome under Emperor Augustus . Dr Favro said this may be why Rome earned its reputation as a city of marble. She said: 'Because they saw construction taking place constantly, I believe people really did think that Rome had been transformed into marble. 'But in reality, the city did not greatly transform.' Many artworks, like the painting above, and historical accounts depict Rome under Augustus as being dominated by marble buildings .", "answer": ["Emperor Augustus boasted about how his rule left Rome 'a city of marble' while historical accounts said it glittered .\nHistorians at the University of California Los Angeles have reconstructed ancient Rome using architectural software .\nThey found that most of the buildings were built mainly from brick and only a few temples were made from marble .\nThose that were made from marble would have been difficult to see from many parts of the city, say the researchers ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "It will be trebles all round on Sunday night when two of the most expensive forward lines of all time come face to face in the Camp Nou – Barcelona’s three-pronged attack of Luis Suarez, Neymar and Leo Messi up against Real Madrid trio Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema. Carlo Anceotti’s threesome have the edge so far this season having scored 56 goals between them — one more than Luis Enrique’s attack. But with Luis Suarez missing the first two months of the season and Messi out of form before the turn of the year, there is a feeling that the Barcelona strike-force gave their Madrid counterparts a head start and are about to go past them. There is also a feeling at a club that has a history of brilliant front threes that this particular Barcelona group could finish up being the best ever. Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar Jnr have netted 55 La Liga goals between them this season . Messi has hit top form for the La Liga leaders after enduring a difficult start to the season . It was in the 2008-09 season that Thierry Henry, Samuel Eto’o and Messi scored 100 goals between them in one campaign with the former Arsenal striker scoring 26, Eto’o 36 and Messi 38. Henry was at the Nou Camp on Wednesday to cover Barcelona’s victory over Manchester City for Sky and went down to the Barcelona dressing room after the game to congratulate the players who could yet break that scoring record this season. Following the Henry/Eto’o/Messi forward line came the Messi/David Villa/Pedro one that also won a European Cup against Manchester United. They scored 98 goals in the 2010-11 season with Messi getting 53, Villa 23 and Pedro 21. Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema have scored 56 league goals between them this season . In the 2008-09 campaign Barca's front three of Thierry Henry, Samuel Eto'o and Messi scored 100 goals . Both attacks had a tendency to come good in the Clasico and Henry played in one of the most famous Real Madrid-Barcelona games in 2009 with Barca winning 6-2 at the Bernabeu, Henry and Messi both scoring twice. On Sunday it is the Barcelona three who are in the best form, although none of them could get past Joe Hart on Wednesday.

{"question": "England must win the RBS 6 Nations title if they want any chance of glory in this year’s World Cup. That is the verdict of hooker Dylan Hartley, who claims the team have put themselves under huge pressure ahead of the home clash with France. ‘I think, timing-wise, this team needs to win something before this World Cup,’ said the Northampton captain. ‘We’ve put that pressure on ourselves.’ England must win the RBS 6 Nations title if they want any chance of World Cup glory, says Dylan Hartley . England hooker Hartley claims they have put themselves under pressure ahead of their tie with France . Stuart Lancaster’s men face a tense afternoon, as championship rivals Wales and Ireland play before them — with the destination of the trophy likely to be decided by points difference. The three leading countries have three wins apiece, but England are top of the table with a points difference of +37, set against Ireland’s +33 and +12 for Wales. Wales face Italy in Rome then Ireland meet the Scots at Murrayfield, so by the time Lancaster’s side line up for a teatime ‘Le Crunch’ at Twickenham, they will know what is needed to earn only the second title success since 2003. Hartley was a member of the side under Martin Johnson who claimed the trophy in 2011, but that feat — after a demoralising loss in Dublin shattered their Grand Slam hopes — does not fill a cherished place in the hooker’s memory. Asked where he kept his medal from that campaign, Hartley said: ‘It’s in a box at home somewhere. When you ask me if I have won the Six Nations, I don’t feel like I have. Maybe until the day we do the Grand Slam it probably won’t feel the same, either. There is always that hanging over us.’ England gather as head coach Stuart Lancaster looks on during the captain's run at Twickenham . Lancaster’s team face a tense afternoon as championship rivals Wales and Ireland play before they do . Defeat in Ireland dashed hopes of a clean sweep this year, but Hartley suggested that securing a title — which would earn the home players a share of a pay-out worth in excess of £2million — in front of a full house at Twickenham would be ‘lovely’. He added: ‘It would be the best achievement in an England shirt, no doubt. All we can worry about is winning the game and letting everything else take care of itself. Our fate is still in our hands. If we get it all right and win well, I don’t think other results will matter.’ Forwards coach Graham Rowntree acknowledged that England could ‘do with winning any championship, any trophy’ and believes a home team containing several novices can handle the high stakes. ‘We’ve got full faith in the guys,’ he said. ‘I think we’ve shown calmness and leadership. We trust the lads’ decision-making.’ England hooker Hartley is eager to secure a title in front of a full house at Twickenham .

{"question": "(CNN)Dropping red meat, and sticking to a plant-based diet that incorporates fish may be the key to preventing colorectal (colon and rectum) cancers, according to a seven-year study published Monday. Pescetarians, as they are commonly referred, had a 43% lower chance of getting the cancer compared to people with omnivorous diets. Why focus on colorectal cancer? It is the third most diagnosed cancer, and the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the US in 2014, according to American Cancer Society statistics. The disease is particularly dangerous because it is usually asymptomatic in its early stages, making it more difficult to detect when it's less deadly. Only 59% of those recommended for screenings receive procedures that are in line with the American Cancer Society's standards. The study, which followed nearly 78,000 people and was published in the Journal of American Medical Association, adds to the growing body of evidence touting the health benefits of a plant-based diet. Another study, reviewing data from 39 separate studies showing that a plant based diet leads to an average drop in blood pressure similar to 30-60 minutes of exercise per day. Yet another study from last year found an average weight loss of nearly 7.5 pounds for vegetarians. While evidence shows the health benefits of reducing red meat consumption, the recent study highlights the differences between even a fully vegetarian diet and a pescetarian diet. Within the sample group there was a 27% drop in the risk of contracting colorectal cancer if you switch from fully vegetarian to eating fish. The authors of the study suggest that omega-3 fatty acids may be the key to such a low risk of cancer in the pescetarian group. Nutritionist Lisa Drayer agrees. \"In addition to other dietary factors, fish may provide added protection from its high content omega-3 fatty acids. This is consistent with previous research that has found omega-3s have anti-cancer activity and that they may be helpful in the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer.\" Some questions can be raised though, from observing the recent study's participants Seventh Day Adventists, a group that typically avoids alcohol and tobacco. But despite the caveat, Drayer is optimistic. \"While the study is observational and cannot prove a cause/effect relationship, it is exciting to think that in addition to regular screenings, a diet rich in fish and fiber-rich foods may play an important role in reducing the risk of colorectal cancer.\"", "answer": ["A new study shows a 43% lower risk of contracting colorectal cancer with a pesco-vegetarian diet .\nColorectal cancers are the third most diagnosed cancers in the U.S.\nPlant-based diets may also contribute to greater weight loss and lower blood pressure ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "His daughter is barely clinging onto life after a suspected drug overdose. But Bobby Brown appeared on a talk show today selling his barbecue sauce - and saying that Bobbi Kristina was 'doing really well'. The pre-recorded segment of Queen Latifah was accompanied by a brief on-screen warning that the interview was 'previously recorded'. But it was not shown throughout the segment, which was broadcast on network affiliate stations around the country. Daily Mail Online has reached out to Sony Pictures, which produces the Queen Latifah show to ask why it was aired. Warning: Viewers were told briefly when Bobby brown arrived on the Queen Latifah show that it was made before his daughter was found drowned in her bath tub . In the course of his appearance, Brown said that his daughter was 'great' and busy working on her music. He joked about how he doesn't like working out and said that Bobbi Kristina had 'the voice of her mother'. But the decision to air it regardless will be seen by many to be in bad taste. Bobbi Kristina is currently unconscious in an Atlanta hospital room after she was found unresponsive in her bathtub on January 31 in a chilling echo of how her mother Whitney Houston died.

With a smile on his face, Brown cooked some shrimp and rice for Latifah to show off his range of barbecue sauces, which he launched last summer. Brown said: 'Smell it! 'When you smell good food, that's when you go into a place to eat, when you can smell it from outside. Fresh peppers and herbs and garlic.' Asked how things are going with his family, Brown said: 'Everybody's great. 'Two of my sons are working on LPs. They drive me crazy, but, you know. They do their thing and I just stand to the side.

There's no chair in sight. His feet are 2 to 3 feet off the ground. His hands are not bound. Is this a suicide? Or is it a lynching -- a shadow from the South's history of racial violence re-emerging? Those were the big questions Friday, one day after authorities found a man's body with bedsheets around his neck in Port Gibson, a small town of just over 1,500 people in rural Claiborne County, about 60 miles southwest of Jackson, the state capital. Evidence collected so far doesn't suggest foul play in the death, law enforcement officials said. For that reason, suicide is the early theory as the likely manner of death, the officials said. Claiborne County Sheriff Marvin Lucas on Friday identified the man as Otis Byrd. Even though authorities have confirmed his name, they still have a lot of work ahead to figure out how Byrd died and who is responsible. \"It could take a week, it could take two weeks, it could take months,\" Lucas said. Authorities expect to receive a preliminary report next week on what caused Byrd's death, Donald Alway, special agent in charge of the FBI office in Jackson, said Friday afternoon at a press conference. He said 30 agents from the FBI, the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation and other agencies are looking for friends and family of the victim \"that might help paint a picture on the cause of death of Mr. Byrd.\" Agents have finished searching the area where the body was found and are looking at a \"storage location\" Byrd owned that might yield information, Alway said. Alway said the FBI is communicating with the family and won't comment on rumors circulating about the death. \"The community deserves answers,\" he said. \"The family deserves answers.\" The body was found at 10:21 a.m. Thursday, deep in a forest about 500 yards from the house Byrd was renting, according to Lucas. A skullcap had been pulled over his head, the sheriff said. That house was the last place where Byrd had been seen on March 2, according to the sheriff. He was reported missing a week later, spurring a search. The body was found by staffers from the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks who were taking part in the search, Lucas said. Thursday was the first time authorities looked specifically in the wooded area where the body was found, according to the sheriff. A family member who did not want to be identified said Byrd was not acting out of the ordinary in the days before he went missing. He went to church, he worked and occasionally ventured to a casino, according to the family member, who described Byrd as a \"good, hardworking man.\" Byrd had been in prison. He was convicted in 1980 of murdering a woman, but was paroled in 2006, according to the Mississippi Department of Corrections. No one has given any indication publicly whether Byrd had enemies. What distinguishes a suicidal hanging from a lynching? Thomas Martin, a veteran crime scene investigator and president of Crime Scene Forensics LLC, said he knew nothing about the Mississippi case but had investigated other deaths by hanging or strangulation. Injuries to the dead person indicate lynching, he said, because it means the dead person struggled with other people before being hanged. When people are strangled by somebody else, investigators sometimes find the deceased has grabbed at the ligature and left finger marks and even bits of fingernails around his neck, he said. The direction of the ligature is another indicator, Martin said. When people hang themselves, the rope often rides up directly behind the ears, he said. When a person is hanged by other people, the ligature moves differently on the neck, he said. Martin said these are general observations and that \"the facts are what make or break the case.\" Mississippi NAACP chapter President Derrick Johnson issued a statement calling on \"federal authorities to immediately investigate the hanging death of Mr. Otis Byrd.\" The FBI already is looking into any federal civil rights violations and has a forensics team on the scene. The U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division and U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Mississippi are also investigating, according to a spokeswoman for the Justice Department. The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation also is investigating. FBI Supervisory Special Agent Jason Pack told WAPT that \"it's too early to say what happened or speculate about the cause or the manner\" of death. \"We don't know what happened out there,\" Pack said. \"We don't know if it was a suicide, if it was a homicide. That's why we investigate these types of cases.\" Lucas, who is himself African-American, said Friday that he's worried people will jump to the conclusion that Byrd was murdered and that race was a factor. \"I don't want the community to go excited saying it was a white-on-black thing. That's the worst thing that can happen, is people making it into a race issue,\" Lucas said. \"And that's my biggest fear.  And I don't want that to happen. CNN's Ed Lavandera and Jason Morris reported from Mississippi, and CNN's Greg Botelho wrote this story from Atlanta. CNN's Evan Perez, Alexandra Jaffe and Wesley Bruer contributed to this report.", "answer": ["Law enforcement officials say evidence collected so far doesn't suggest foul play .\nForensics expert talks about how evidence differs in suicides and lynchings .\nFBI agent says a report on the cause of death is expected next week ."], "label": "SUM"}

'We are extremely proud to be the first club to partner with a charity such as Prostate Cancer UK by renaming our stadium, albeit temporarily,' chief executive Gary Sweet told Luton's website. 'We felt sure that once the full story emerged about our supporting Prostate Cancer UK, our supporters would understand and fully support the move. 'This is a first for Luton Town and a first in football and we are delighted to be teaming up with a charity which has supported the game, in particular supporters and players past and present, so well.' It is the first time an English stadium has been named after a charity. Prostate cancer claims the same number of men's lives a year as the capacity of Luton's home ground . Luton are in the promotion playoff places, occupying sixth position in the table, 12 points behind leaders Burton Albion. Prostate Cancer UK director of fundraising Mark Bishop, said: 'The power of sport - and in this case football - has helped us reach out to men and their friends and families.

{"question": "When it comes to leaders on the pitch Ireland coach Joe Schmidt knows he is blessed. Leading out the Grand Slam chasers against Wales in the Six Nations in Cardiff on Saturday will be talisman Paul O'Connell, the giant lock who will be earning his 100th international cap. O'Connell has captained Ireland in all but two of the 16 tests since Schmidt took charge but his style of leadership means other players are given their head when it comes to making decisions in the heat of battle. Ireland fly half Jonathan Sexton has been in superb form for his country this season . Ireland captain Paul O'Connell is set to win his 100th cap against Wales in Cardiff . Sexton works on his ball skills as head coach Joe Schmidt (right) watches on at the Millenium Stadium . 'One of the other things is that Paul doesn't assume every leadership responsibility, he delegates and he encourages and so that is one of the fantastic things for the coaches as well,' Schmidt told the Irish Times. 'It means Jamie (Heaslip) has a definite role. He has some particular things that he leads on, that Johnny Sexton does, that Rob Kearney does, Peter O'Mahony, we have got a number of provincial leaders, Rory Best, who step up and take different roles of leadership. 'So I think of the best things about Paul is that he doesn't try to carry the whole weight of leadership on his own shoulders.' O'Connell will pack down with Leinster lock Devin Toner in the engine room the Irish pack . 'He is incredibly driven to improve his own performance and thereby leads others in doing that.' Fly-half Sexton, who will win his 50th cap against Wales, said O'Connell's very presence, both on and off the field, is an inspiration. 'He's an outstanding leader,' Sexton said. 'When he speaks to the squad during the week the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. 'He know how important his words are.' Sexton's predecessor and long-time team mate of O'Connell, Ronan O'Gara added: 'Paul is very, very special in terms of the ability to deliver the right message at the right time.' That quality will be especially handy in the red-hot cauldron of the Millennium Stadium where Wales, after their opening loss to England, have put themselves back in contention for the title. Victory would leave the grand slam tantalisingly close with an away match against struggling Scotland to finish. 'It's a massive game for a whole lot of reasons. An opportunity to do what no Irish team has ever done in the history of the game,' Schmidt said.", "answer": ["Ireland will clash with Wales at the Millenium Stadium on Friday .\nJoe Schmidts side are unbeaten after three rounds of action .\nPaul O'Connell is set to win his 100th cap against Warren Gatland's side ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "Sanaa, Yemen (CNN)A coalition of Middle Eastern forces continued pounding rebel targets in Yemen from the air on Friday, the second day of a campaign aimed at the Houthi group. While it was hard to immediately determine the extent of the damage and destruction, the resounding sounds of huge explosions heard around Sanaa on Friday night suggested that the Saudi-led strikes were taking a toll. The strikes' target is Houthi rebels, a Shiite Muslim minority group that has taken over the capital and, on Wednesday, captured key parts of the Yemeni port city of Aden. Aden was where President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi had moved because of the rebel advance. Hadi has since left Yemen, and on Friday he'd arrived in Egypt for a summit of Arab League representatives. Many nations in the Arab League are now participating in the armed effort against the Houthis and presumably to return Hadi to Yemen as its leader. While he's not in Yemen, the fierce fighting there continues. Not surprisingly, the Houthis are bearing the brunt of the bloodshed -- and not just in Sanaa. That includes at least 10 killed in the northwestern province of Saada, home to the Houthi's leader Abdul Malik Al Houthi, Houthi commanders said. More than a dozen more people were wounded, as 15 locations saw airstrikes. Five Houthis died were hurt in an attack by fighters loyal to Hadi on a Houthi post about 6 miles (10 kilometers) outside Al Anad airbase, two security officials in Lahj province said. That's where U.S. Special Operations Forces involved in fighting al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula had been based as recently as this month. Hadi has also ordered the closure of all Houthi-controlled media -- including Yemen TV and Saba TV. The Houthis, though, responded by raiding two TV channels and the prominent Al Masdar newspaper. Al Jazeera's office in Sanaa was also targeted, with Houthis looting security cameras and damaging equipment, the Qatar-based network said. The nations stepping into Yemen's civil war are predominantly Sunni Muslim, and they are working to rescue a government that has strong Sunni support. The Houthis are allied with majority Shiite Iran. Saudi Arabia, the largest contingent in the intervention dubbed al-Hazm Storm, considers the Houthis to be proxies for the Shiite government of Iran and fear another Shiite-dominated state in the region. \"What they do not want is an Iranian-run state on their southern border,\" CNN military analyst Lt. Col. Rick Francona said of the Saudis. The kingdom says Hadi, who is out of the country, pleaded for military intervention in a letter. \"I ask you, based on the principle of self-defense in Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, and on the basis of the Charter of the Arab League and the treaty of joint Arab defense, to provide instant support by all necessary means, including military intervention to protect Yemen and its people from continuous Houthi aggression,\" read the letter, which was posted by Saudi Arabia's Foreign Ministry. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Thursday that the United States commends the military action and is supporting it through intelligence sharing, targeting assistance and logistical support, a senior State Department official said. The other nations participating in the military action are the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Jordan, Morocco, Sudan and Egypt, a Saudi adviser has said. The adviser also included Pakistan, saying its military was offering naval support. But on Friday, that country's Defense Ministry said it had only vowed to defend Saudi Arabia, according to a local media report. Saudi Arabia and Egypt have spoken about the possibility of sending ground troops. Saudi Arabia has blockaded the Houthis, effectively cutting off their supply lines. By Thursday afternoon, the Saudis controlled Yemeni airspace, the adviser said, and the military threatened to destroy any naval ships trying to enter Yemeni ports. Supreme leader Al Houthi spoke live Thursday night in Yemen on al-Masirah TV, saying, \"If any army tries to invade our country, we will prove that Yemen will be a grave for those who invade us.\" Iran denounced the military intervention. Marzieh Afkham, a spokeswoman for the country's Foreign Ministry, said the operation will throw an already complicated situation into further turmoil and disrupt chances at a peaceful resolution to Yemen's months-long internal strife. It also won't help a region already facing terrorist threats from groups like ISIS and al Qaeda, she said. \"This is a dangerous action against international responsibilities to respect countries' national sovereignty,\" Afkham said, according to a report in Iran's state-run Islamic Republic News Agency. At least one major player in Yemen besides the Houthis -- the General People's Congress, which is the party of longtime leader Ali Abdullah Saleh -- thinks the Saudis and their partners should stay out. The GPC says the airstrikes have already led to civilian casualties. The best way to stop the bloodshed is to bring everyone to the negotiating table, the group said.

{"question": "The average intelligence of the human race has been steadily increasing, scientists have claimed. In research looking back over IQ tests from the past few decades, they found that the tests were becoming harder - but people were still doing just as well. But the reasons why people are becoming smarter is not known - with theories including better education and improved medical care. Researchers at Kings College London looked at scores over 64 years. In total, more than 200,000 participants in IQ tests were studied. Since 1950, average intelligence was found to have risen by about 20 IQ points. Explanations include better education (stock image shown) and improved medical care . The research, titled A Cross-Temporal Meta-Analysis of Raven's Progressive Matrices and reported by William Kremer for the BBC, was published in the journal intelligence. Carried out by Peera Wongupparaj, Veena Kumari and Robin Morris from Kings College London, they looked specifically at the Raven’s Progressive Matrices (RPM). Poverty affects the intelligence of children as young as two, a separate study in December 2014 found - and its impact increases as the child ages. Deprived young children were found to have IQ scores six points lower, on average, than children from wealthier families. And the gap got wider throughout childhood, with the early difference tripling by the time the children reached adolescence. Scientists from Goldsmiths, University of London compared data on almost 15,000 children and their parents as part of the Twins Early Development Study (Teds). The study is an on-going investigation socio-economic and genetic links to intelligence. This tasks participants with looking for patterns in an array of shapes - and is thought to be a good measure of intelligence. In total, more than 200,000 participants from 48 countries over 64 years were studied in the research. Since 1950, it was found that the average intelligence had risen by the equivalent of 20 IQ points. 'RPM is a valid and reliable measure of general IQ, Dr Wongupparaj told MailOnline. 'Also, it is cultural-free test so that it has been widely used for nearly 80 years.' ‘IQ tests are designed to ensure that the average result is always 100, so this is a significant jump,’ the BBC reported. The research builds on earlier evidence from philosopher and psychologist James Flynn, from the University of Otaga in New Zealand. He had noticed that IQ tests were getting harder, but people were still getting similar scores on them - which became known as the Flynn Effect. This graph shows how the Raven’s Progressive Matrices (RPM) scores have been increasing over time. RPM is seen as an accurate way of measuring intelligence, and 'it is cultural-free test so that has been widely used for nearly 80 years,' Dr Wongupparaj told MailOnline . The research was carried out by scientists from Kings College London. They looked specifically at the Raven’s Progressive Matrices (RPM) - an example is shown. This tasks participants with looking for patterns in an array of shapes - and is thought to be a good measure of intelligence . Apparently, if modern Americans took a test from a century ago, they would get a relatively high average IQ score of 130; vice versa, and our ancestors would score a measly average of 70. This equates to a three-point rise in IQ per decade. According to the new study, though, outside of the US the biggest change was clearly in developing countries, IQ was ‘catching up with the developed world’. ‘There are multiple possible reasons proposed for this phenomenon,’ they write. These include improved education, increased exposure to testing, improved medical care and nutritition and decreased family size. Perhaps most importantly, though, is that the instance of IQ increasing was not just true in general for the world as a whole - but could also be noticed on a much smaller scale. ‘The Flynn effect is strong enough to be showed in even small and non-representative samples as well as in the very young and older adults,’ the researchers conclude.", "answer": ["Researchers at Kings College London looked at scored over 64 years .\nIn total, more than 200,000 participants in IQ tests were studied .\nSince 1950, average intelligence was found to rise by about 20 IQ points .\nExplanations include better education and improved medical care ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "Taking a stance: Openly-gay Apple CEO Tim Cook criticized new laws that critics say will allow business owners to openly discriminate . Apple CEO Tim Cook has spoken out against two new laws in Indiana and Arkansas which critics say will allow business owners to refuse service to homosexual customers based on 'religious liberty'. Cook condemned the laws, saying they were 'very dangerous', went against the founding principles of America, and would take the country back to the days of 'Whites Only' signs in shop doorways. He added that, as a Baptist, he supports religious freedom, but said: 'I was never taught, nor do I believe, that religion should be used as an excuse to discriminate.' Cook, 54, who came out as gay in October last year, made the comments in an op-ed for the Washington Post. He wrote: 'In total, there are nearly 100 bills designed to enshrine discrimination in state law. 'On behalf of Apple, I'm standing up to oppose this new wave of legislation. 'These bills under consideration truly will hurt jobs, growth and the economic vibrancy of parts of the country where a 21st-century economy was once welcomed with open arms.' He also addressed legislation in Texas that 'would strip the salaries and pensions of clerks who issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.' He said such bills 'rationalize injustice' by 'pretending to defend' religious freedom, which actually eroding the freedoms of others. Cook drew upon his background growing up in the South in the 1960s and 1970s, during and immediately after the Civil Rights movement when blacks were still heavily discriminated against. He says America's 'days of discrimination' must remain 'deep in the past' and said freedom and equality is a value that is at the heart of his company. He added: 'Apple is open. Open to everyone, regardless of where they come from, what they look like, how they worship or who they love.' Scroll down for video . Marching: Thousands gathered outside the Indiana Statehouse on Saturday to hold a rally against the new law, which forbids the government from 'substantially burdening' a person's religious beliefs . As well as opposing the Indiana law, in a tweet he called for Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson to veto a similar bill, HB1228, which has passed through the senate and is waiting to be rubber-stamped by the Republican. HB1228 is also named the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and uses the same wording as the Indiana legislation. The Indiana bill forbids the state or local government from 'substantially burdening' a person's religious beliefs unless that burden is 'essential' to further a 'compelling' government interest, and is the 'least restrictive' means of achieving that aim. It allows people or organisations to use the legislation as a defense in court against claims of discrimination against them, and if the court rules in their favor, allows reparations, including compensation payouts. Indiana's religious freedom act says that the state and local government 'may not substantially burden a person's right to the exercise of religion' unless that burden is 'essential' to furthering a government interest. It will be up to the courts to decide what counts as 'substantial', but the legislation was largely designed to fend off lawsuits against those who refuse to participate in gay marriage ceremonies. For example a florist who refuses to supply flowers for a same sex ceremony. Supporters say that such provisions already exist in 20 other states, and were actually signed into federal law by Bill Clinton in 1993. But opponents, including Cook, claim these laws form part of a wave of discriminatory powers that threaten to reverse years of progress on equality issue . It will be up to the courts and judges to decide what constitutes 'substantial', but critics fear that the broad scope of the law and the tough tests that must be passed to override it, mean that it will allow business owners to openly discriminate in how they operate. Cook is far from the only one opposing the new law in Indiana, with musician Miley Cyrus, and actors Ashton Kutcher, James Van Der Beek and George Takei all speaking out against it. The NBA, WNBA, the Indiana Pacers, and Indiana Fever issued a joint statement Saturday reaffirming their commitment to non-discrimination. Hillary Clinton also messaged to her three million Twitter followers saying that 'we shouldn't discriminate against people because of who they love' following the bill's passing on Thursday. Businesses are also lining up to oppose the legislation, threatening to pull investment or even boycott the state altogether in protest. Website Angie's List also announced plans to cancel a $40 million expansion to its Indianapolis headquarters because of the new law. 'Angie's List is open to all and discriminates against none and we are hugely disappointed in what this bill represents,' the company's CEO Bill Oesterle said in the statement. Salesforce.com founder and CEO Marc Benioff also announced on Twitter that he would no longer send employees or customers to Indiana. Proud: Cook said that, being born a Baptist, he supported religion, but added: 'I was never taught that religion should be used as an excuse to discriminate' (Cook pictured centre at gay pride parade in San Francisco) Making a statement: Cook previously expressed opposition to the new laws in Indiana and Arkansas on his Twitter page . Cook's op-ed came after thousands gathered outside the Indiana Statehouse on Saturday to rally against the law, waving rainbow coloured flags and chanting slogans such as 'no hate in our state'. Since the law passed, Republican Senator Mike Pence has robustly defended it, saying that it is necessary to help people defend themselves against 'government overreach'. He also ruled out any possibility of repealing the law, which is due to take effect in July, telling This Week with George Stephanopoulos, that 'the law will stick.' Pence said there was a 'tremendous amount of misinformation and misunderstanding' surrounding the legislation, forms of which are already enshrined in law in 20 other states. Pence told the Indy Star he will support legislation to 'clarify' the controversial law, and expects it to go before the General Assembly this week. While he did not discuss the wording of the new bill, he has previously said the intention of the law is to block government intervention in matters of conscience, rather than allowing people to discriminate against others.", "answer": ["Tim Cook, 54, condemned religious freedom law in Indiana and Arkansas .\nApple CEO said bills 'rationalize injustice' by pretending to defend religion .\nThey will take U.S. back to days of 'Whites Only' signs in stores, he said .\nLaw forbids government from 'substantially burdening' religious beliefs ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "The day before George Osborne delivers his budget to the nation the Lawn Tennis Association came up with its rough equivalent – the latest long term plan to revive the state of the game in Great Britain. Chief Executive Michael Downey finally unveiled his vision for the governing body, and in budgetary terms the big winner will be those people involved in marketing the sport and trying to get more people playing it. Over the next four years there will be a 50 per cent uplift in money spent on marketing, so that by 2018 around £26 million will be spent on promoting the sport of tennis in the United Kingdom. While Andy Murrayis established as one of the world's best players, problems still exist at grass roots level . Other countries will look on enviously at such a huge sum although, given the current rankings of most GB juniors, many may well comfort themselves that their stocks of elite players will be superior for years to come. Downey reaffirmed the LTA's laudable, broad policy of building the game from the bottom up by concentrating on participation and talked through a range of worthy and sensible measures to help achieve this. However, there was nothing especially original to stir the imagination or make an impact with the wider public, no 'Parks tennis revolution' or some such thing. Anyone wanting to see something more radical to improve the British game would be left disappointed. Not that Downey, the former head of Tennis Canada who was appointed 18months ago, pulled all of his punches in presenting the latest of what have hitherto been doomed long-term plans for the British game. LTA Chief Executive Michael Downey has unveiled his long term strategy to rejuvenate the game . 'Our sport is declining and some people have a problem hearing that,' he said at the start. What he was specifically referring to was the problems tennis, like most other ball sports, has with declining participation numbers. They all face a challenge from what he termed 'doorstep' sports, highly convenient and less technically demanding activities such as running, cycling, swimming and going to the gym, which can be done solo and whenever time permits. Despite the hundreds of millions gleaned from Wimbledon profits and that event's ever growing popularity, there has been an average drop of 5 per cent in adult participation over each of the past five years. The particular problem is among the 16-44 age group with numbers steady above that. Curiously he omitted to mention, until asked, that tennis is now played to a greater or lesser extent in 20,000 schools among 2.6 million children, an impressive figure that would be envied by most other sports. Among the smorgasbord of measures to improve things, there will be a drive to increase participation in parks tennis. 'I think the old LTA would have driven by the parks and straight into the clubs and schools,' he said. The LTA receives millions annually from funds generated by the Wimbledon Championships . There were other sensible ideas. With tennis participation peaking in July, there will be a concerted effort to get people to start playing earlier in the year. Clubs, volunteers and coaches will get more support (attempts at this are nothing new). In junior tennis there will, wisely, be more emphasis on team events and there will be a much-needed concentration on creating a less pressured environment at junior tournaments. The emphasis will be on creating inclusive fun and recreational competitions across the board. Downey asserted that he was looking at the 'meat and potatoes' issues, rather than eyecatching initiatives. He also pledged that the LTA would spend money 'like it's your own' (no reference here to his own £434,000 pay package). It is, clearly, expecting too much for any results to be instant, as with the efforts to improve the elite end of tennis. He was unrepentant about cuts to the performance side of the game and funding for lower ranked players, pointing out that the average entry age into the world's top 100 is 21 for men and 20 for women. Murray's victory at SW19 in 2013 spiked interest but there has been a five per cent fall in adult participation . 'If you are 27 years old and still playing Futures I don't think you are going to be a top 50 player. It's a ruthless business,' he said, reiterating the 'no compromise' message he wants to run through the elite end of the sport. While there has to be a degree of patience with his plans, they also illustrated the glacial pace of how things tend to be done at the governing body compared to what would happen in the more dynamic private sector. There are many things that have not even been considered or barely thought about. Andy Murray, for instance, is nearly 28 and there is still no clue as to how to use his profile to spread the game. (Downey presented his ideas to him in Glasgow two weeks ago and was impressed by his interest.). Downey has spoken to Murray after Britain's 3-2 Davis Cup win over USA in Glasgow . TV advertising during the summer is not on the agenda. If there is an embracing of the excellent Tennis For Free charity and its proven methods then it seems limited. The whole key issue of playing surfaces did not raise a flicker, nor did the idea of adopting foreign training base with clay courts and a better climate. No participation targets have been set. The simple idea of trying to rebrand the organisation from its anachronistic 'Lawn Tennis Association' title to something more modern is apparently a non-starter for some reason. What was presented, though, was steady and sensible enough, while not especially imaginative nor wide in scope. Like most budget speeches, the effects of its contents will not be immediately obvious.", "answer": ["LTA have unveiled their long term plan to get more people playing tennis .\nThere will be 50 per cent increase in marketing budget over next four years .\nThere has been five per cent drop in adult participation over last five years .\nChief Michael Downey has spoken to Andy Murray on spreading the game ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "James Collins is set to play a key role in Wales' Euro 2016 campaign but manager Chris Coleman admits he chose Cardiff's busiest shopping centre for peace talks between the pair so things could not turn ugly. Collins will win his 45th cap in Wales' crunch qualifier against Israel on Saturday night with Hull defender James Chester sidelined by a dislocated shoulder. But it was not so long ago that the West Ham defender's international career appeared over after player and manager fell out following Collins' withdrawal from a Wales squad. James Collins was all smiles as he trained with the Wales squad in Cardiff on Wednesday ahead of their trip to Israel for a Euro 2016 qualifier . Collins contradicted Coleman's claim he had turned down the chance to join the squad as a late call-up prior to the World Cup qualifier against Serbia in September 2013 and the pair had a tense public rapprochement in the middle of Cardiff. 'We had a coffee in the middle of St David's Shopping Centre so it could not kick off!' Coleman revealed. 'There were too many people around so we had to be civil. 'We had our spat, but I have known him since he was a kid and always liked him, and when he has been with us he has been right in the middle of everything. His presence and personality are going to be very important going forward.' Collins has had to bide his time to regain his place at the heart of the Wales defence with Chester having developed an excellent understanding with skipper Ashley Williams since making his international debut last summer. Chris Coleman (right) has cleared the air with Collins as he instructs his backroom staff during training . The 31-year-old has yet to feature in a campaign which sees Wales unbeaten after four games and within a point of Group B leaders Israel. But asked if falling out with him has made Collins value Wales more, Coleman replied: 'Yes, absolutely. I think that is the case. 'This is an opportunity for 'Ginge' now. He was brilliant in the last camp, as were Danny Gabbidon and Sam Ricketts who did not play but were great round the dressing room in Brussels. 'That is great for the younger guys because it is good to have advice from senior players. ''Ginge' likes the challenge and the atmosphere we will find ourselves in, it will be a dogfight which he enjoys.' Collins has earned a recall to the Wales team after impressing in defence for West Ham this term. Here he celebrates a win over Sunderland with team-mate Stewart Downing .

Coleman also played down security concerns ahead of Wales' first trip to Israel since the two countries met in a play-off qualifier for the 1958 World Cup in Sweden. Israel have a game in hand on Wales as their September fixture with Belgium was postponed because of the political situation in the Middle East at the time but that match will now be played next Tuesday. 'We have not got any extra security to my knowledge,' Coleman said. 'I did the journey from the airport to the hotel when I was out there last month and we will treat it like any other game. 'We know a lot is going on in certain quarters but there are no worries, there are no extra precautions that we would not usually take.'", "answer": ["James Collins and Chris Coleman fell out in September 2013 .\nDefender's late withdrawal from a Wales squad saw him exiled from team .\nBut duo met for public coffee to prevent either from 'kicking off'\nUnbeaten Wales travel to Israel for Euro 2016 qualifier ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "(CNN)Real Madrid's star-studded attacking force might be struggling to fire, but Barcelona coach Luis Enrique has no such problems with his wealth of talent up front. Sunday's 6-1 demolition of Rayo Vallecano put the Catalan side one point above Real at the top of Spain's La Liga, with Lionel Messi setting more records as he netted a hat-trick while fellow forward Luis Suarez also scored twice. Even without suspended Brazil star Neymar -- the third prong of Barca's striking line -- Enrique was able to happily reflect on a result that fully rubbed salt in Madrid wounds following Saturday's 1-0 defeat at Athletic Bilbao. \"We're elated, but the objective is to be leading at the end of the season. I already said that everybody could lose a game, so we have to keep playing well and win every match,\" he said. \"It's heavy having to win every single match. Each game is more important than the last.\" By contrast, Real coach Carlo Ancelotti is feeling the strain after also dropping points last weekend against Villarreal. \"There is no link-up play, our play is too based around individual play, we need another way of attacking, with faster play and fewer touches,\" said the Italian, who must rouse his troops for Tuesday's European Champions League last-16, second-leg tie at home to Schalke. \"It is quite confusing to see what we're doing at the moment in attack. The ball doesn't move around quickly.\" While Real's front trio of top scorer Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale are struggling to match their form from the first half of this season, Barca's star men are moving into menacing mode ahead of the rival teams' \"El Clasico\" clash at the Nou Camp in a fortnight. Messi's 32nd career hat-trick is a record for a Spanish club player, and took him past Ronaldo as the La Liga leader on 24 trebles. The Argentina star also drew level with the Portugal captain as the Spanish league's top scorer this season on 30 goals. It's the sixth successive season in which he has topped 40 goals, with 41 from 38 games so far this campaign. Suarez has now scored six goals in his last four games, and 13 from 26 overall appearances since joining from English club Liverpool after a World Cup that ended in a lengthy ban for his bite on Italy's Giorgio Chiellini. \"Suarez and Messi are having more and more chemistry, and today we all saw what they bring to the team,\" Enrique said. \"I like (Ivan) Rakitic wherever he plays on the field. He always knows what to do with the ball and is one of the best signings we've ever had.\" \"(Gerard) Piqué has always known how to score, above all on set plays. It's a perfect solution for games when our opponents collapse defensively.\" Both teams had a player sent off in front of a crowd of over 87,000, Barca's best this season: Rayo defender Tito for a foul on Suarez in the 55th minute that allowed Messi to make it 3-0 with a retaken penalty; and Dani Alves for tripping Alberto Bueno, who also netted the resulting spot-kick. Barca's 20th win from 26 league games put the club seven points clear of third-placed Atletico Madrid after the defending champion's 1-1 home draw with fourth-placed Valencia later Sunday. Koke put Atletico ahead in the first half but Shkodran Mustafi headed an equalizer with 12 minutes left, while Valencia teammate Javi Fuego received two late yellow cards. Sixth-placed Villarreal beat Celta Vigo 4-0, while Real Sociedad beat Espanyol 1-0 in a mid-table clash. In Italy, second-placed Roma missed a chance to put pressure on leader Juventus after being held 0-0 at struggling Chievo Verona on Sunday. It left Rudi Garcia's team eight points adrift of Juve, which hosts Sassuolo on Monday. Third-placed Napoli also drew, blowing a two-goal lead against Inter Milan as Rodrigo Palacio and Mauro Icardi, with an 87th-minute penalty, canceled out second-half goals by Marek Hamsik and Gonzalo Higuain. In Germany, Bayer Leverkusen moved up to fourth with a 3-0 win at Paderborn as South Korea striker Heung-Min Son scored two late goals after a 73rd-minute opener from Greece defender Kyriakos Papadopoulos. In France, Lyon restored a one-point lead at the top of the table with a 5-1 win at Montpellier, as young midfielder Nabil Fekir scored twice.

{"question": "The White House is reportedly considering a new power play in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that would paint Benjamin Netanyahu into a corner just days after his stunning come-from-behind victory in his country's hotly contested elections. In the final days of campaigning, Netanyahu vowed in an historic U-turn that his government would never agree to the creation of a Palestinian state. But now President Barack Obama is contemplating using the United Nations as a trump card to force the issue. Under a plan outlined by Foreign Policy magazine, the U.S. State Department would ease away from decades of opposition to a Security Council resolution demanding peace talks and a final rapprochement between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. The White House cautiously avoided commenting on its future plans on Thursday when it was bombarded with questions by reporters on the topic, saying only that it would 'evaluate what our path is forward' is in light of Netanyahu's comments. NOT SO FAST ... The White House is considering a Netanyahu smackdown in the form on United Nations leverage to force him into breaking a campaign promise about peace with Palestinians . WATCHING AND WAITING: State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Wednesday that the US is evaluating its options – leaving the door open for lifting opposition to a UN two-state solution pushed on Israel . The U.S. and Israeli leaders have a famously chilly relationship. A former top-level Obama campaign aide helped organize voters aligned with Netanyahu's political opposition – even as the president refused to meet with Netanyahu this month, saying he didn't want to influence the election's outcome. The Obama administration hoped to see Netanyahu's left-wing rival, Isaac Herzog, prevail on Tuesday. Diplomats at the UN privately learned in the run-up to Election Day that the U.S. would not press the UN Security Council on peace talks if Herzog were to win, since he would likely have carried the ball on his own. But with Netanyahu poised to organize a coalition government comprised of right-wing and ultra-Orthodox parties opposed to a Palestinian state, all bets are off. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters on Wednesday that 'we’re currently evaluating our approach. We’re not going to prejudge what we would do if there was a UN action.' The chief spokesman for 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue reiterated the administration's position on Thursday and made clear that no decisions had been made yet on the United States' part. He also refused to characterize the president's reaction to Netanyahu's victory, stating that, obviously, the president was 'aware' of it when asked by a reporter if Obama was 'disappointed' with the election results. Complicating the situation, the Palestinian Authority says it might take grievances against Israel, stemming from last year's brief Gaza war, to the International Criminal Court. The Palestine Liberation Organization’s top diplomat in the United States explained to Foreign Policy that the PA could formally accuse Israel of committing war crimes when it fired rockets into populated areas in response to sustained attacks. Israel has said it did all it could to avoid casualties among civilians, but insists militants from the Hamas terror group took shelter where collateral damage would be greatest in order to discourage return fire. Turning to the ICC for redress would prove costly for Palestinians, however. The United States provides about $500 million in annual aid to the PA, and $400 million of that is drawn from an Economic Support Fund that members of Congress from both sides of the political aisle have threatened to cut off. The U.S. has paid out approximately $5 billion in aid money to the Palestinian Authority since the 1990s, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service – representing about one in four dollars it receives from the international community. But at the end of January an astonishing 75 out of 100 U.S. senators signed a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry warning that any Palestinian action against Israel in the ICC would be met by a budget axe. The 2015 budget appropriations bill, signed by Obama, explicitly prohibited funding for the PA if it were to initiate – or even actively support – an ICC probe related to war crimes accusations against Israel. BIG CHILL: President Barack Obama has had the frostiest relationship with Israel of any US leader since the 1970s . The senators warned Kerry that Abbas was illegally challenging 'Israel’s legitimate right to defend its citizens and territory.' PA President Mahmoud Abbas officially joined the ICC late last year. In the days following the seating of the new Congress in January – long before Netanyahu notched his surprising re-election win – the State Department seemed to lean toward supporting the Senate. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters then that action in the ICC could have unspecified 'implications' for future U.S.-Palestinian aid. 'Congress has a great deal of power in that regard,' she said. But administration officials are now leaning toward using the United Nations to force Netanyahu into a tricky spot. 'We are signaling that if the Israeli government’s position is no longer to pursue a Palestinian state, we’re going to have to broaden the spectrum of options we pursue going forward,' a U.S. official told Politico. And Jeremy Ben-Ami, who leads the pro-Israel but left-wing group J Street, told the paper that he expects the Obama administration to look very closely at the possibility of either joining, or at least not blocking an internationally backed move at the UN to restate the parameters for ending the [Arab-Israeli] conflict.' White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough's remarks to the group on Monday at its national conference in Washington, D.C. could shed further light on the administration's position. The Israeli election, and the Obama administration's reactions, come against the backdrop of U.S. negotiations with Iran over its nuclear ambitions and Netanyahu's forceful objections that a nuke in Tehran would be an existential threat to Israel. Kerry, America's top diplomat, phoned Netanyahu to congratulate him on his victory, but did so from Switzerland where he was meeting with his Iranian counterpart.

{"question": "The world’s first roller-skating artist has says she wants to reinvigorate traditional Chinese art for the next generation - by painting with wheels instead of a pen. Tian Haisu’s latest painting, ‘Blood-Lane-Line’ has gone on exhibition in the California College of Arts, The People's Daily Online has reported. The artist has ditched the calligraphy pen, which has been used for more than a thousand years in traditional Chinese painting, for a pair of skates, after being inspired by her favourite sport, ice skating. Chinese artist Tian Haisu paints her huge art using roller skates instead of the traditional calligraphy pen . The artist has adapted the skates so that they can hold a pot of paint, which releases as she weaves around the canvas . Tian, who started painting aged just three years old, adapted her skates especially so that a pot of black paint could be attached to them - a technique which she says makes her feel ‘at one with her art’. Through the new medium, she says she wants to give the traditional Chinese landscape painting a whole new lease of life. She said: ‘My whole body is involved and I produce all kids of ink landscapes. ‘Such creation is full of power, speed and rhythm. Tian has called her unique technique 'landskating', and say it makes her feel at one with her art . ‘I am so passionate about ink landscaping because it shows very rich emotions by means of simple forms. ‘I call it landskating.’ Born in Sichuan in 1988, Tian is a graduate of the San Francisco Art Institute and is currently studing at the California College of Arts. She first exhibited her work aged just 18 and her painting ‘Waiting’ was snapped up by the Beijing Olympic Committee in the year the Olympics were held in the China. Since then she has exhibited across China and the US - from Chengdu to Beijing and New York to San Francisco. The finished artwork is entitled 'Blood-Land-Line' and is deliberately hung so that the top half is on the wall, as a way of symbolising the link between heaven, earth and art . Tian is a critically-acclaimed artist currently studying at the California College of Arts . As well as winning numerous awards for her paintings, she has now been appointed a goodwill ambassador for the Beijing Huaya Education Fund. Her latest painting, measuring 13 metres (43 feet) tall by six metres (20 feet) wide was deliberately hung so that the top half was on the wall and the bottom half flowed onto the floor.

{"question": "An elderly couple who had been married for more than 50 years stepped in front of a speeding freight train just minutes after a row with their 50-year-old daughter, an inquest heard. Peter Smith, 80, and his wife Betty, 78, walked a short distance from their bungalow in the picturesque Lincolnshire village of Cherry Willingham, to the unmanned crossing on July 9 last year. Less than half an hour earlier, Mrs Smith and her only child, Jane, who had recently moved back in with her parents, had an disagreement over where she was keeping her belongings. Tragic: Peter Smith, 80, and his wife Betty, 78, walked a short distance from their bungalow in the picturesque Lincolnshire village of Cherry Willingham, to the unmanned crossing, pictured, on July 9 last year .

She said that she and her father, a former postmaster, had not had 'the best relationship over the years'. She said: that she and her mother had a disagreement over whether she could store some of her belongings in the spare room.

{"question": "A striking set of twins, who were born with radically different colouring thanks to mixed-race parentage, have revealed how they constantly have to explain their looks to curious strangers. Appearing on ITV's Good Morning Britain, Lucy and Maria Aylmer, both 18, said classmates at school thought they were telling fibs when they revealed they were twins. Lucy and Maria's mother Donna is half Jamaican and their father Vince is white, and in a genetic quirk, together they managed to produce one white twin and one black twin. Lucy (left) and Maria (right) Aylmer, both 18, have faced questions from curious strangers throughout their lives over their radically different looks. Lucy even uploaded a photo of her birth certificate to Facebook . The twins say it isn't just their looks that are different, they have individual personalities too. Lucy (far left) says she's much more shy than her sister Maria (second left), despite being born 23 seconds before her . Speaking to Ben Shepherd and Susanna Reid, the twins, from Gloucester, opened up about how their distinctively different looks had often made life difficult at school. Red-haired Lucy said her pale complexion had prompted speculation that she'd been adopted: 'My classmates used to ask if I was adopted because my siblings are all quite dark. 'It was pretty hard, it went on in secondary school and it wasn't very nice.' When the girls were first born in 1997, their mother Donna had no idea that she could give birth to such different looking twins, described by experts as a one-in-a-million chance. Growing up, the girls said they regularly overheard people asking their mum 'Which one is yours?' or 'Are you the childminder?'. Although most of their friends now know their unique story, they still have to present new acquaintances with photos of their birth certificates to prove they really are twin sisters. 'Our friends do believe us now because we make a big fuss,' says Maria. 'We've got birth certificates. Lucy even had a picture of hers on her Facebook [profile].' As the girls have turned into grown-ups they've tried to find their own style. Lucy, who has naturally curly hair, straightens it to ensure a sleek look. And the twins stopped wearing the same outfits when they were seven. Lucy says: 'I think I said to my mum: \"I don't want to wear the same clothes as Maria any more\".' Same same, but different:  Lucy and Maria Aylmer, 18, from Gloucester are non-identical twins . When asked at what age the girls knew their situation might raise questions from others, they say it took them a long time to know that their family was anything but ordinary. 'It is what it is,' says Maria. 'We never even picked up on it until friends started talking about it at school.' Their mother, who is 47 and a warehouse worker, and their 53-year-old father, who works as a scaffolder, split up after the twins were born. The 18-year-olds have three older siblings, George, 23, Chynna, 22, and Jordan, 21. Lucy told the Daily Mail: ‘Our brothers and sisters have skin which is inbetween Maria and I. We are at opposite ends of the spectrum and they are all somewhere inbetween. ‘But my grandmother has a very fair English rose complexion, just like mine.’ She added: ‘No one ever believes we are twins. Even when we dress alike, we still don’t look like sisters, let alone twins.’ Family line: The twins' mother Donna is half Jamaican and their father Vince is white, and their siblings George, Chynna and Jordan all have darker skin than Lucy and lighter than Maria . Two of a kind: The twins, who live in Gloucester, were born in January 1997 . Different strokes:  'Outgoing' Maria studies law at Cheltenham College, while 'shy' Lucy studies art and design at Gloucester College . All together: Maria and Lucy with their mother Donna and siblings George, 23, Chynna, 22, and Jordan, 21 . Non-identical twins come from separate eggs, so inherit different genes. The girls’ half-Jamaican mother carries genes for both white and black skin. By chance, Lucy will have inherited genes for white skin and Maria will have genes that code for black skin. People with Afro-Caribbean heritage often have some European DNA, dating back in many cases to the slave trade. This increases the chance of them passing on a gene for white skin to at least one twin. Lucy said of her time at school: ‘We were in the same class, but no one had a problem telling us apart. Twins are known for swapping identities. But there was no way Maria and I could ever do anything like that. ‘Most twins look like two peas in a pod – but we couldn’t look more different if we tried. We don’t look like we have the same parents, let alone having been born at the same time.’ The twins’ interests are as different as their looks. Lucy studies art and design at Gloucester College whilst Maria studies law at Cheltenham College. Lucy explained: ‘Maria was outgoing whilst I was the shy one. But Maria loves telling people at college that she has a white twin – and I’m very proud of having a black twin.’", "answer": ["Lucy and Maria Aylmer, 18, from Gloucester are non-identical twins .\nGrowing up,  mother Donna would be asked if she was their 'childminder'\nDonna is half Jamaican and their father Vince is white .\nTwins say they have radically different styles ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "The mother of a man who stands accused of murdering 12 people in a movie theater gun rampage has begged prosecutors to stop pursuing the death penalty, terming their legal case a 'quest for death'. Arlene Holmes, whose son James, 27, opened fire at a busy screening of Batman film The Dark Knight Rises in Aurora, Colorado, also insists that she and her husband Robert 'were good parents'. The Holmes family claim that mental illness is to blame for the murder spree, which left 70 injured as well as the 12 fatalities. Scroll down for video . Begging for his life: Arlene Holmes prayed for prosecutors to stop their 'quest for death' in seeking a death penalty punishment for James Holmes, left, who killed 12 people in Aurora, Colorado, in 2012 . 'Good parents': Holmes and her husband Robert, pictured above this week, have said the killings are the fault of their son's mental illness . Massacre: James Holmes opened fire at the Century 16 movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, killing 12 people and injuring 70 who were watching Batman film The Dark Knight Rises . They believe their son was having a psychotic episode during the killings, and should therefore be spared death in his trial, which is due to begin on April 27. Mrs Holmes begged the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty in an entry in her prayer book, which she published earlier this month and is selling for $15. Her prayer for the prosecutor reads: 'I do not know what you have been through in life. I do not know why you want to pursue execution of a mentally ill man. 'But I pray for you, so that you will find peace in your life. I pray you will change your mind. Please stop this quest for death so you may focus on those who are alive.' She also also gave an interview on the book to the Del Mar Times local newspaper from her home in Rancho Penasquitos, California, saying that offering her son a plea deal would prevent a painful trial. 'Good parents': Holmes suggested that she and her husband Robert, right in the above image, had not done anything wrong . She said: 'This would all come to a grinding halt if [James] could plead guilty, and the DA would accept the plea for life without parole.' Mrs Holmes also defended herself and her husband from charges that they contributed to the massacre. She said: 'Because so many people like to blame the parents if a child is mentally ill, we have to reaffirm to ourselves every day that we were good parents and good people, and this still happened anyway.' Mrs Holmes did, however, say the couple feels guilt 'that we didn’t recognize he was ill and needed treatment.' On sale: Holmes published a book of prayers for people involved in the murder, which sells for $15 . According to her, the killing was completely out of character, and the first time she was aware of her son having anything to do with guns. She told the Del Mar Times: 'Our kid was quiet, compliant, obeyed all the rules. He never bothered anyone, he never harmed anyone... We never owned a gun and he showed no interest in guns.' This is the first time Mrs Holmes has been interviewed since the killings in July, 2012. The couple had remained entirely silent until last December, when they wrote a letter to the Denver Post newspaper, insisting that their son 'is not a monster'. Other parts of Holmes's book deal with her feelings at each stage of discovering her son was responsible for the massacre. In an entry from Jan. 12, 2013 called Preliminary Hearing Memories, she wrote: 'What were you thinking, Jim? And what are you thinking now? Praying for Jim in jail; please don't commit suicide. 'You lived so that we could understand you and others could study you and learn to prevent future tragedy.' In another from March 22, 2013, titled Memories, she again defended her son. She wrote: 'My son never harmed anyone. People think he is a monster, but he has a disease that changed his brain. ... Praying for good men and women engulfed in psychosis and alone with their disease.' Mrs Holmes writes in the book that proceeds will be donated to mental health services, not to her son or his case. But victims' families have questioned the timing, as defense attorneys have asked a judge to move the proceedings, saying pretrial publicity has made many prospective jurors biased against Holmes. 'I can only think this is some kind of ploy. This is some type of strategy cooked up by the defense to try to save someone's life,' said Tom Sullivan, whose son Alex was killed in the shooting. 'Ploy': The father of victim Alex Sullivan, pictured, described Holmes's book as a 'strategy cooked up by the defense' Holmes' mother's thoughts and apologies mean little to him, he said.

{"question": "(CNN)She married a man whose first wife mysteriously disappeared. And she stood by him even after he admitted killing a neighbor and chopping up the body. But who is Debrah Lee Charatan, the wife of millionaire heir Robert Durst? And what role has she played in his life? Charatan hasn't spoken publicly since her husband's arrest in New Orleans over the weekend, and CNN was unable to reach her for comment. In \"The Jinx,\" the HBO documentary about Durst's life, she appears in a police interview from more than a decade ago. The series also includes excerpts from jailhouse recordings of phone conversations between Durst and Charatan. Charatan says she met Durst in 1988, six years after his first wife went missing. The two were married in a rushed ceremony just weeks before Durst's longtime friend Susan Berman turned up dead in Beverly Hills, California. This week, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office charged Durst with first-degree murder in that case. It's an accusation he has long denied. He also has said he had nothing to do with his first wife's disappearance. In a 2003 trial, he admitted he'd shot a neighbor in Galveston, Texas, and dismembered the body, but was acquitted of murder after arguing he'd acted in self defense. Recorded jailhouse calls from Durst's imprisonment during that case suggest that Charatan was his rock. \"Am I supposed to be smiling or am I supposed to be grim?\" Durst asks in one conversation discussing how he should appear during his trial. Charatan quickly replies, \"I would just have as close to no expression, yeah, that's what I think.\" She was also a driving force behind the decision to fire attorney Michael Kennedy, a lawyer Durst's wealthy real estate developer family had tapped to handle the case. The insanity defense Kennedy was planning to use, she said at the time, could have meant both Durst and Charatan were cut out of the family fortune. \"What he doesn't want is me to get any of the trust money later on, since I'm not your wife because you were incompetent at the time, OK, that means they are the only ones who can make your decisions,\" she says in another call. Like Durst himself, Charatan is a powerful player on the New York real estate scene. \"She's not some opportunistic woman who came into Bob's life for monetary gain. She was very successful, a millionaire several times over long before she met Bob,\" said Amir Korangy, publisher of TheRealDeal.com. Susan Criss, the retired judge who presided over the 2003 trial, said from listening to hours of tapes and testimony that it's clear that Charatan is motivated by financial gain. \"It's very clear that she only cares about the money,\" Criss said. Some former friends and employees described Charatan in less than glowing terms. Former employees have successfully sued her for failing to pay commissions. According to sources, she only briefly lived with Durst and they are now separated, though still married. Why doesn't the HBO documentary feature any more recent interviews with her? Charatan didn't want Durst to participate in \"The Jinx,\" Korangy said, and she hasn't spoken with him since it started airing. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet and Erin Burnett contributed to this report.", "answer": ["Debrah Lee Charatan is Robert Durst's second wife .\nShe hasn't spoken publicly since his arrest in New Orleans .\nShe told police she met Durst in 1988, six years after his first wife went missing ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "The Taliban have reportedly captured an former US military base in the western Afghan province of Farah. The news was released through a 16 minute video, in which dozens of Taliban fighters are shown being driven into the fortified base.

Having beaten a host of highly regarded players to reach the fourth round of Indian Wells last week, she nearly came unstuck against the nuggety Russian, ranked a modest 95 in the world. It was a testament to Watson’s fighting qualities, rather than an advert for the silky skills of the WTA Tour, but hardly less worthy for that. Heather Watson celebrates during her three sets victory over Russian qualifier Evgeniya Rodina . Watson is currently ranked 41 in the world, three off her all-time best. She now faces Germany’s Angelique Kerber, the number fifteen seed, who has tumbled out of the top ten and is scratching around for any kind of form in 2015. The British No 1 is having to do it solo as well, as the only female player from Wimbledon’s host nation to inhabit the top 150 in Laura Robson’s absence. It is a bleak situation, and there seems little in the way of any coherent performance plan from the Lawn Tennis Association to improve things. The 22 year-old from Guernsey usually benefits in these conditions from having spent much of her teenage years in Florida, although not much can make the kind of steaming heat encountered on Wednesday much more comfortable . 26-year-old Evgeniya Rodina hits a forehand during the prolonged contest in Miami with Watson .

'All children deserve the opportunity to learn and achieve their potential.' Education of girls not only further their independence, it also cuts the rate of child deaths, teen pregnancy and helps to provide more stable families.

Education also has a great impact on sexual and reproductive health outcomes for girls and women. In many countries in sub-Saharan Africa, for example, the birth rate among girls with no education is over 4x higher than those with secondary education. Providing education for girls also helps to fuel economic growth of a country. An educated female population increases a country's productivity, yet some countries lose more than £650 million  a year by failing to educate girls to the same level as boys. For example, if all girls in Kenya completed primary education, their additional output would equal 20 per cent of Kenya’s GDP. If all adolescent girls completed secondary education and delayed pregnancy until their twenties, this would add £2 billion to the Kenyan economy every year.

{"question": "1 RAHEEM DREAM . Naturally Kane-mania has kicked in, but the trio of players who started in forward positions for England are creating a bit of a stir. ‘Europe will fear us now,’ declared Wayne Rooney and although it was a little optimistic, the front three are moving in the right direction. Roy Hodgson calls Raheem Sterling and Danny Welbeck his ‘five yard furies’, two players capable of causing chaos in opposition defences. With Rooney alongside them, they are flourishing. This was undoubtedly one of Sterling’s best games in an England shirt: he read Rooney’s pass to score and later sent in the left wing cross for Harry Kane’s debut goal. Raheem Sterling stole in at the near post to tuck the ball home for England's third against Lithuania . Sterling is forming a impressive understanding with Wayne Rooney and Danny Welbeck . Sterling’s double nutmeg on Tomas Mikuckis and Marius Zaliukas, all completed in the same 18th minute move, was outrageous. Lionel Messi did something similar to James Milner during Barcelona’s totalising of Manchester City in the Champions League and the world went into meltdown. Sterling likes the trick, too. Welbeck was also one of England’s most prominent players, an increasing influence on this team as they head towards Euro 2016. He has the trust of his manager. Unfortunately Welbeck will probably miss the game against Italy because of a knee injury and Sterling is heading back to Liverpool for an injection on a long-standing toe injury. 2 SOMETHING TO SING ABOUT . England dropped to 17th in the FIFA world rankings earlier this month and yet the support for the national team is unwavering, even on a Friday night and against opposition as poor as Lithuania. England supporters were even singing ‘Roy Hodgson’s barmy army’ after Wayne Rooney had scored his 47th goal for his country against Lithuania. This was close to a full house at the national stadium for a routine victory, England’s fifth successive win in this qualification campaign. England fans flocked to Wembley on Friday night despite the latest in a long line of mediocre opposition . The atmosphere remains a problem and the FA would do well to change the playlist to whip up the Wembley crowd before the two teams emerge from the tunnel before kick-off. They did at least turn to old favourite Carnaval de Paris, but what’ s wrong with a bit of tub-thumping by playing some of the other terrace anthems, such as New Order’s World in Motion and the Lightning Seeds’ Three Lions? Bring them back. 3 PLAN FOR THE FUTURE . Roy Hodgson would have offered his resignation if England lost their opening group game against Switzerland last September, but they emerged with a positive 2-0 victory from that tricky night in Basle. Suddenly this emerging team has momentum, stringing together victories and establishing a winning mentality in that England dressing room. Roy Hodgson must prepare this team and tailor it accordingly to take on the big guns at Euro 2016 . We have seen this before, with England unbeaten in their last two qualifying campaigns for Euro 2012 and World Cup 2014. Sadly, we know what happened the moment England ran into some opposition with real pedigree and class. Hodgson must prepare this team and tailor it accordingly to take on the big guns at the tournament next summer. England have plenty of possession in games against Lithuania, but will they dominate territorially against world champions Germany, hosts France or Spain? Hodgson, who has the backing of his players in this qualification campaign, must plan accordingly if the national team is to avoid a repeat of the performance in Brazil. 4 NEW BOYS SHINE . The options appear to be increasing for Hodgson as this team beds in for the qualifying campaign, selecting a starting eleven with players from eight different clubs (Manchester City, Southampton, Everton, Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester United, Arsenal and Aston Villa). Manchester United and Liverpool are well represented on the field, but props to right back Nathaniel Clyne and central midfielder Fabian Delph for forcing their way into the first team ahead of some established, international players. Delph, who worked hard alongside Michael Carrick and Jordan Henderson in the centre of England’s three man midfield, was denied his first international goal by the brilliance of Giedrius Arlauskis in goal for Lithuania. Clyne is an accomplished player and he has been a breath of fresh air in his opening three games for his country. All three - Slovenia, Scotland and Lithuania - have resulted in victories. Fabian Delph has managed to force his way into the England side ahead of some more established players . 5 TRUE TEST IN TURIN . Roy Hodgson firmly believes that he has put the nightmare of last summer’s World Cup in Brazil behind him, but their next opponents will provide a brutal reminder of the past in their next game. England were beaten 2-1 in Manaus in their opening group game and were out of the tournament after another defeat, against Uruguay in Sao Paulo. On Tuesday, England head to Turin for a prestige friendly against Antonio Conte's side, but much has changed in the Italian camp since the World Cup. Eder (centre) was born in Brazil but now has Italian citizenship and could face England next week . Mario Balotelli, who scored Italy’s 50th minute winner in the Arena de Amazonia on June 15 2014, has been told he will never be selected again under their new coach. Instead Italy, who play Bulgaria on Saturday in a Euro 2014 qualifier, are stitching together a new side under the former Juventus coach. FA chairman Greg Dyke won’t like the look of it, that’s for sure: Palermo forward Franco Vazquez was born in Argentina and Eder, who plays for Sampdoria in Serie A, was born in Brazil. They now have Italian citizenship and are both in the Italy squad.

John Marshall, told his lawyer that a neighbor had approached him with a gun and that he had fatally shot the unnamed man in a scuffle earlier on Wednesday afternoon, said Robert Harris, Marshall's attorney and owner of the Harris Law Firm. Marshall, 52, had a swollen lip, a freshly missing tooth, another tooth that is chipped and what looked like two broken thumbs, Harris said. John Marshall, pictured right in a previous mugshot,  told lawyer Robert Harris that a neighbor had approached him with a gun and that he had fatally shot the unnamed man in a scuffle earlier on Wednesday afternoon . Marshall's green pickup sat for much of Wednesday afternoon at the back of Marshall's law firm with crime scene tape around it and a dead body in the back . He told Naples Daily News that Marshall looked 'like he'd been in a fight for his life.' Marshall told Harris he'd been at one of his properties in Bokeelia when his neighbor had come at him with a gun. Marshall said his neighbor pistol-whipped him, knocking out a tooth, and said the two ended up in a wrestling match on the ground, each man squirming for the gun. After killing his neighbor Marshall said he brought the man to the attorney's office because he didn't know who else to trust. Harris called 911 shortly after his client arrived at the law firm about 4 p.m. Harris said the man was cooperating with authorities. The two men had been in some sort of dispute over property work in Bokeelia, Florida, Harris told News-Press.com. Robert Harris' law firm is located in downtown Fort Myers. Harris told reports that the incident involving Marshall was the 'cleanest-cut case of self defense I've ever seen' A few days ago, Marshall came to the law firm looking for advice about his neighbor, whom he considered a threat. Marshall said he was doing some construction around his property that the two had argued about. Marshall had plans to file for a restraining order, according to Harris.

{"question": "Host commentator . That's it from Sportsmail's live El Clasico Q&A. Thanks for following and thank you for some brilliant questions. Until next time! Pete Jenson: A lot depends on who makes a move and on how much they are willing to pay. If a club bid £90million for Bale or £65m for Ronaldo (bearing in mind he is 30), I think Real Madrid would consider it. Ronaldo because it would make economic sense and Bale because it would not be unpopular with Real supporters. They definitely won’t sell both! And quite possible both will stay but it will be an interesting summer, especially if they win nothing and supporters are demanding an overhaul of the squad. Pete Jenson: The better players were in playing the Clasico and yet the best goal of the six that were scored came at Anfield from Juan Mata. I enjoyed both games. There were away fans in the Liverpool vs Manchester United game – that is something that is always missing from a Clasico. Pete Jenson: Fair assessment, yes. Ronaldo was as motivated as I’ve seen him recently. Perhaps a week of talk about Messi being the greatest ever had contributed to that. He also helped set the tone of the first half with the at run at Alves as soon as he got the ball. He took his goal well and was one of those Madrid players who didn’t deserve to be on the losing side. Messi had a strange night. He seemed to be staying out on Marcelo’s wing because that is where there is usually plenty of space. But Madrid pressed so well he didn’t see a great deal of the ball. He certainly didn’t run the game as he did against Manchester City. But I agree once Modric and Kroos had faded in the second half he began to impose himself. Pete Jenson: It was the 42nd Clasico he’d played some part in – no Barcelona player has played in more. What he always contributed was calm. By Spanish football standards Barça vs Madrid games are usually very frenetic and yet he always seemed to have an extra second of time and a extra yard of space. He’ll come back to this fixture as Barcelona manager one day, you can count on it. Pete Jenson: The most shameful thing about it is that we have seen incidents in recent years of players collapsing on the pitch and sometimes even dying. So to feign serious injury is pretty unforgivable. I don’t mind the roll-over-ten-times merchants so much because it has a certain comic value, but the hand over the face when actually you’ve just been hit in the shoulder is very tiresome. Pete Jenson: He was poor in the first half and it was his miss just before Ronaldo equalised that made the game such a contest. He improved in the second half but I think sometimes the more frenetic and physical the game the more he tends to just get bumped around the pitch. You have to give him some credit for that double-breasted red leather blazer he was wearing after the game though. I don’t think he’s very happy for several reasons. Firstly he is not really sure why scoring the winning goals in the Copa del Rey final and the Champions League final last season does not seem to have earned him any respect from the club’s supporters – he gets whistled in at the Bernabeu if he puts one pass out of place and so-called ‘fans’ have tried to kick out at his car when he drives away from the training ground (it happened again in the early hours of this morning). He is also not too sure why when he was such a success as an out-and-out forward last season he is being asked to do a more defensive job this year. CLICK HERE to read the full story as angry Madrid fan attacks Bale's car . Pete Jenson: He wants to come back to England, no doubt about it. Arsenal would give him all the job security he has missed out on at first Chelsea and now Madrid. Paul Clement would I’m sure go with him back to his home city and Arsenal – who seem terrified that if they move Wenger on they will stop qualifying for the Champions League – would have a coach who has won the competition three times. It all sounds perfect, I don’t know why the wheels have not already been set in motion! Pete Jenson: In one sense he doesn’t have to adapt that much because this Barca does not play like the old Pep Guardiola, Barca. We saw that last night with their goals coming from a long ball and a set play. He has also come through the Ajax school, and Brendan Rodgers’ Liverpool don’t exactly play like Harry Basset’s Wimbledon so a fast passing game is not exactly alien to him. It’s more about striking that fine balance between being selfish when the goal is gaping, and not ignoring his pal Messi when he is in a better position than him. Pete Jenson: Immense. Pique has developed a reputation over the last couple of years for being more focussed on his poker hand or his online games business than his football but he has blown away those theories this season. The greatest compliment paid to him last night was that he played like Carles Puyol. He will always be very different from his old central defensive partner but in terms of concentration and throwing himself in front of the ball when he had too it was a real leader’s performance. Pete Jenson: No one stays in the job very long. They had 25 managers in the 25 years that Sir Alex Ferguson was at Old Trafford and old habits die hard. It’s incredible to think that Ancelotti hasn’t been immortalised by adoring supporters after winning ‘La Decima’ but he hasn’t and unless they win the league or the Champions League this season there will be a change. Zidane will almost definitely manage Real Madrid one day. It could happen this summer but that will be down to him deciding if he is ready as much as anyone else putting him in charge. Pete Jenson: Bale is at his best when he is given free reign going forward. Last night in the first half he was asked to play wide right in a four-man midfield as opposed to up-top in the three of a 4-3-3. He put a decent shift in but if he’s working back he can’t also be on Jordi Alba’s shoulder waiting to pull away. This is why I still think from a purely football perspective he could still be tempted by a move to a club where he would be the star striker with fewer defensive responsibilities. He also faded last night because the team did – Modric and Kroos both ran out of juice in the second half and the team suffered. Pete Jenson: It’s been a long time since I can remember seeing him dive. I think the Premier League cured him of that. And he is also alongside Messi now, and Messi very rarely dives. But he does lay it on a bit thick sometimes when he goes down I agree. Look at it from his perspective though, he is up against Ramos and Pepe, both are clattering him at every opportunity for 90 minutes; and Pepe enjoys the dramatics too. So if a little exaggeration gets him one extra favourable decision from the referee then he sees it as fair game. Pete Jenson: It was tough for him at first because he could no longer be as single-minded as he was at Liverpool. In the Premier League he knew that when the ball came to him his responsibility was to just to take the quickest route to goal. At Barcelona he’s got Neymar on one side, Messi on the other and he tried too hard at first to be unselfish. But Barcelona need him to be selfish sometimes and last night when Alves played the ball forward there was only one thing on his mind. I’m not sure he’ll score as many goals as he did at Liverpool in one season – but he will score more important ones.

{"question": "A 'quiet pint' at the local pub turned into a 7,000-mile trip to Thailand for two British men – armed with just a Tesco carrier bag containing some clothes. Company director Phillip Boyle, 33, had decided to go for a beer at the Southern Cross pub in Middlesbrough with friends for a relaxing Friday night. But one turned to two and then three and more - and at 1am Mr Boyle, along with friend Jamie Blyth, 33, decided to go home. However, their decision soon led them halfway around the world. Phillip Boyle, 33, (far left) and friend Jamie Blyth, 33, (second left) pictured with friends they met in Thailand . After leaving the pub they stopped off for some more beers from the petrol station along the way. It was back at Mr Boyle's house where the two, in their drunken stupor, decided to book a taxi to Manchester Airport in the morning and fly to Thailand. Mr Boyle said: 'After lots of jokes, at around 11am the next day with a hangover, Jamie asks if I had my passport handy and came up with the idea of us going to Thailand straight away. The pair flew from Manchester Airport to Pattaya, Thailand with a stopover in Abu Dhabi . 'Quiet drink': Mr Boyle had decided to go for a beer at the Southern Cross pub (pictured) in Middlesbrough with friends for a relaxing Friday night . 'I thought he was joking at first and then he pointed out how there are quite a few lads from Middlesbrough over there we hadn't seen for a while. Travelling light: Mr Boyle admitted he only took a Tesco bag with a few pairs of boxers and T-shirts . 'Then we got into a taxi he'd phoned and - apart from the short delay of picking up Jamie's passport - we were off to Manchester Airport. When we got in the taxi we didn't even have flights. 'It's a last minute bad idea - but one of those bad ideas that turns into a good idea.' Mr Boyle revealed that while battling a hangover, he managed to pack a Tesco carrier bag with some boxer shorts and a few T-shirts. The journey to the airport saw Mr Boyle come close to cancelling as the alcohol started to wear off, but once they arrived at Manchester, the pair managed to book flights to the Far East. The key protagonist may have been rigger Mr Blyth, who was recognised by the taxi driver as having splashed out on these last-minute trips numerous times in the past. It was then that the taxi driver revealed that it wasn't the first time Mr Blyth had done a similar flit - having used him several times before to make similar last-minute trips. Mr Boyle said: ‘The taxi driver told me how Jamie had done this same last minute thing four times now, with him being the same driver to take him to Manchester in each case. I thought that was hilarious and then said “OK, I'm in”.’ Flights from Manchester to Pattaya were secured. With a stopover in Abu Dhabi it amounted to two seven-hour trips. 'Some of the lads have serious girlfriends and kids and it's been pretty intense for some of them,' added Mr Boyle. A few quiet beers in Middlesbrough ended up with a trip to Thailand (above) for Mr Boyle and his friend . 'I wouldn't like to be facing the grief that some of them will be inevitably going home to. 'But no-one's misbehaved to be fair. I think it's a place where younger lads would perhaps go crazy. I'm single right now - so no consequences to face for me.' The pair are making their way back to Middlesbrough today. Mr Boyle added: 'I'd never fancied Thailand before - so going last minute for a few days is perfect. 'Today we're by the pool and out to complete our version of The Hangover.'", "answer": ["Company director Phillip Boyle visited Middlesbrough pub for drink .\nMr Boyle bought more beers from petrol station and returned home .\nHe and friend Jamie Blyth decided to book morning taxi to airport .\nWith hangovers, they flew from Manchester to Pattaya in Thailand .\nMr Boyle packed carrier bag filled with boxer shorts and T-shirts .\nMr Blyth had used the same taxi driver before to make similar trips ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "Sampdoria striker Samuel Eto'o has revealed he was the victim of racism during his time at Chelsea. The Blues have been in the spotlight recently after five supporters were ordered to appear in court over an alleged racist incident on the Paris Metro. A Paris Saint-Germain fan appeared to be prevented from boarding a train before his side took on Chelsea in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 clash. Samuel Eto'o trains with Sampdoria amid claims he was the victim of racism while in London . Eto'o celebrated his 33th birthday with his team-mates after a trainign session on Tuesday . Five men will appear at Waltham Forest Magistrates' Court on March 25 in connection with the incident in Paris. Eto'o spent last season at Stamford Bridge and scored nine goals in 21 Premier League appearances, but has revealed there was one unpleasant event during his time in west London. 'I went to go buy a watch at a jewellers, not too far from my house,' he told CNN. 'The watch I wanted to see was expensive. And I asked the saleswoman - who was also black - \"Could you show me that watch please?\" 'I saw her turn to her co-workers like, \"Uh, what should I do?\" Eventually, she let me see the watch. I looked at it and said, \"OK, I’ll buy it.\" I took out my credit card and when she went to go run it through the machine, she came back and said that it was declined.

{"question": "A British Airways pilot threatened to kill himself by crashing a jumbo jet five years before the Germanwings disaster in the French Alps last week. Robert Brown killed his wife in a horrific attack with a claw hammer, and the next day he considered deliberately crashing his Boeing 747 in order to 'make a statement'. Now his victim's family say they fear that airlines have not learned from the case and are not making enough effort to assess whether pilots are genuinely fit to fly. Scroll down for video . Parallels: Robert Brown, left, threatened to crash a plane full of passengers just like Andreas Lubitz, right . Victim: Brown killed his estranged wife Joanna, pictured, by repeatedly hitting her with a claw hammer . Brown's case has chilling parallels to that of Andreas Lubitz, who last week flew a plane into the Alps, killing 150 people, after suffering from depression. He had told BA that he was suffering from stress as a result of his divorce from wife Joanna, and consulted his GP about his illness, but carried on working anyway. In October 2010, Brown argued with his wife while dropping off their two children at her home in Ascot, Berkshire, and hit her 14 times with a claw hammer. He then buried her body in Windsor Great Park - but he told his murder trial that he had considered crashing a plane the next day after being harassed by Joanna's lawyers. 'I thought something needs to be done,' Brown said. 'I thought I want to fly one last time and crash the aircraft. I wanted them to be held accountable. 'I thought if I got to work I could crash an aircraft, or fly to Lagos and crash it there or hang myself in the hotel room. I wanted to make a statement.' Sporty: Brown, a British Airways pilot, is pictured on a long-distance run in BA-branded kit . Warning: Joanna's mother Diana Parkes, right, says airlines should have learned from the case . Instead, he called in sick and another pilot stepped in to fly the BA jumbo jet to Nigeria. Brown was arrested later the same day, and subsequently convicted of manslaughter and jailed for 26 years. Joanna's mother, Diana Parkes, told the Daily Telegraph that following the case airlines should ahve done more to ensure that pilots cannot endanger their passengers. She said: 'Robert Brown's claim in court that he planned to ditch a commercial flight the day after he killed her was chilling to hear, and yet there has never been any acknowledgement from British Airways that lessons can be learnt from that.' The victim's best friend Hetti Barkworth-Nanton said that there were 'chilling similarities' between Brown's case and that of Lubitz, who were both fitness fanatics. Brown told his BA bosses that he was feeling stressed out, but they did not follow up the conversation to check that he was in a fit mental state to fly, she said. Plane: Brown had been due to fly a British Airways Boeing 747 similar to this one (file photo) Similarly, Lubitz was apparently signed off from work following a struggle with depression, but ripped up the doctors' notes he was given excusing him from flying. Mrs Barkworth-Nanton told the Telegraph: 'Neither should have been allowed to fly and put the lives of their passengers at risk. In both cases there were things the airlines should have picked up on. The warning signs were there. 'Robert's terrible crime resulted in him taking the life of Jo, but it could have been much worse, and myself and Jo's family feel that airlines are not learning the lessons of these tragedies.' Lubitz is believed to have locked the pilot out of the cockpit during Germanwings flight 4U9525 from Barcelona to Dusseldorf last Tuesday, before deliberately crashing into the Alps killing all 149 other people on board. Work to retrieve the bodies of the victims from the crash site high up in the mountains is continuing six days after the disaster.", "answer": ["Robert Brown killed wife Joanna in 2010 and was due to fly a BA Boeing 747 the next day .\nTold his murder trial he considered crashing plane 'to make a statement'\nCase has 'chilling similarities' to that of Germanwings pilot Andreas Lubitz .\nJoanna Brown's relatives say airlines should have learned from the case ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "Lululemon is hoping to boost sales among men with a new genital-friendly range of pants. Lululemon Athletica Inc told Bloomberg on Thursday that its ABC pants - referring to their 'anti-ball crushing' design - have given the company a 16 per cent  sales hike in the men's sector of the business last quarter. The Canada-based company's website describes the pants as 'ABC (anti-ball crushing) engineering gives you and the family jewels room to breathe'. Scroll down for video . Lululemon Athletica were hoping their men's ABC pants - referring to their 'anti-ball crushing' design - would boost sales . The men's pants were described by the company as 'giving you and the family jewels room to breathe' The site goes on: 'A wide paneled gusset and four-way stretch Warpstreme fabric make these pants commute, travel and sweat ready.' The Vancouver-based company made its mark on the sports retail market with yoga clothing . Consumers were divided over the ABCs. One man wrote: 'Despite the waist, the fabric is amazing however the legs were so tight and the fabric so thin. If I wore these out everyone would know what underwear I have on by being able to see the lines, that's how tight the thighs are.' But a happy customer posted: 'I love these pants. I wear them as casual, for work (I am a financial advisor) and I wore them to yoga once just to see how flexible they are and they were excellent. 'They are great as travel pants, very comfortable on the plane or driving the car.' Another added: 'Got the grey initially and was pretty satisfied. I would say there was reduced ball crushing, but they are still pretty snug in the thighs and crotch.' The company, which is headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia, offers a range of athletic wear for men along with smarter clothing. There are 'sweat, post-sweat and no sweat categories'. The athletic brand, set up by Dennis 'Chip' Wilson in Vancouver in 1998, opened its first men's store in the Soho neighborhood of Manhattan on Black Friday last year. And the company is taking advantage of a boost in sales from men's attire and expanding the ranges in stores. According to the company's 2013 annual report, Lululemon had 211 locations. However despite the launch of the ABC pants, shares in Lululemon slumped almost 6 per cent on Thursday. Even though the company raised its expectations for 2015, Wall Street has been looking for even more and its first-quarter outlook disappointed as well. Lululemon earned $110.9 million, or 78 cents per share, for the period ended February 1. That compares with $109.7 million, or 75 cents per share, a year earlier. Sales at stores open for at least a year climbed 5 per cent in the quarter, but declined 1 per cent for the year. For the year, the Canadian company reported an adjusted profit of $1.89 per share on revenue of $1.8 billion. Shares of Lululemon fell $3.38 to $57.58 before the market had opened. Chip Wilson, the founder of Lululemon Athletica Inc., stepped down from the company board last month. He had resigned as chairman last year after controversy about comments he made about customers' body types. In March 2013, the retailer had to issue a massive recall of its black yoga pants after women discovered they were transparent.

{"question": "Radamel Falcao has admitted for the first time that he is likely to leave Manchester United at the end of the season. The Colombia star has stayed silent amid speculation that United will reject the opportunity to turn his £5million loan from Monaco into a permanent £43m deal. But Falcao conceded on Tuesday that he will probably have to look elsewhere for regular first-team football, having not started a game under Louis van Gaal for the last month. Radamel Falcao dropped a major hint that he could leave Manchester United when his loan expires . ‘Obviously I need to find a place where I have continuity and can play,’ Falcao said in Bahrain, where Colombia play a friendly on Thursday. ‘I think any footballer needs to play and is happy playing. ‘So when the championship ends surely I’ll sit down, do an analysis and decide what’s best for me.’ Falcao has scored just four goals in 22 appearances for United, where he earns £280,000 a week, and was made to play for the club’s Under 21 team earlier this month. His mentor and former agent, Silvano Espindola, revealed last week that the player has been reduced to tears by his treatment at Old Trafford. Liverpool are being linked with the 29-year-old striker but it is understood that Paris Saint-Germain, Juventus and Valencia are more likely destinations. The Colombian has been more used to starting from the bench for the Reds this season . ‘Calls come every day so in that sense I’ve got to stay calm, but I keep on the fringe of them, there are people who deal with all that situation,’ said Falcao. ‘I owe myself to Manchester United at the moment, I have faith and hope because lots of things can happen in the number of matches remaining. I will continue to fight to the end at Manchester United.’ While United are happy to let Falcao leave Old Trafford, they will do all they can to ensure that £59.7m record signing Angel di Maria stays. The Argentine is said to be unsettled in England just seven months after arriving from Real Madrid. Falcao came on as a substitute in United's win against Liverpool on Sunday and has scored just six goals . Di Maria’s form has dipped after a bright start and his family have been unhappy since an attempted break-in at their Cheshire home last month. United midfielder Marouane Fellaini, meanwhile, has refuted suggestions that his presence in the team leads to a long-ball game, saying: ‘We play beautiful football.’ Robin van Persie could return against Manchester City on April 12 following a month out with ankle ligament damage.

{"question": "Britain has undergone a boom in self-employment as mothers seek out more flexible careers (file image) Britain has undergone a boom in self-employment as mothers seek out more flexible careers, the Bank of England claims. Since 2008, the number of self-employed workers has risen by almost 700,000 from 3.8million to 4.5million. One in seven people in employment now work for themselves, compared to one in eight before the recession. The Bank said ‘large numbers’ of people had chosen to go freelance or set up their own business, in recent years, but the rise was particularly noticeable among women. While self-employment among men has remained ‘roughly flat’, more women now work for themselves so they can better juggle childcare, they said. A report by the Bank noted ‘growing self-employment among female workers’, pushing up the overall rate in the U K. ‘Part of this rise could reflect the desire to maintain a work-family balance and flexibility of hours’, they said. The Bank also reported a significant rise in so-called ‘silver entrepreneurs’, as more over 65s remained in the workforce. They said: ‘Older workers are more likely to be self-employed than younger workers. ‘This is perhaps because they have accumulated more knowledge or experience to start businesses. ‘Or it could be because they prefer the greater flexibility that self-employment offers. Growing numbers are now working well into their 70s as Britons live for longer. The number of older workers increased after the default retirement age was abolished in 2011, making it illegal for employers to force staff to retire at 65. The Bank said that around half the increase in self-employment in the last 10 years was associated with ‘the ageing of the workforce’. Improvements in computer technology have made it easier for people to start their own business, the Bank said, with entrepreneurs able to sell their goods online instead of the ‘need for traditional bricks and mortar stores’. Previously, critics have suggested the rise in self-employment was because those who lost their jobs during the economic crisis had been unable to find new ones. But the Bank dismissed this theory and said the increase actually reflected a ‘longer-term trend’ in Britain. It said: ‘While the recession may have pushed some workers into self-employment where they might otherwise have been unemployed, there is little evidence to suggest this was a major factor in the rise of self-employment.’ There was also a rise in the number of over 65s who are still in work, according to the figures (file image) The Trades Union Congress said the most common part-time self-employed jobs for women were hairdressers and cleaners, which are typically low-paid. They claimed that, while many women choose to work part-time, there had been ‘a marked increase in the number of women moving into part-time jobs since the recession because they couldn’t find full-time employment’. Shadow Business Secretary and Labour MP Chuka Umunna also claimed self-employed people had been the hardest hit by the cost-of-living crisis and that incomes had fallen. The Association of Independent Professionals and the Self Employed yesterday disputed this bleak picture, however, and welcomed the Bank’s report. Simon McVicker, of IPSE, said: ‘With the report categorically stating that the increase in those working for themselves has not happened out of economic necessity, it is hoped the report will sway those, most notably the Labour Party, still clinging to the belief that the rise of self-employment represents increased insecurity in the labour market. ‘The report supports the findings of our own research that has repeatedly shown the UK’s independent professionals to be masters of their own destiny rather than becoming their own boss out of enforced or hidden unemployment. ‘The self-employed now constitute almost 15 per cent of the workforce and have been the catalyst for economic growth and recovery in the UK and it is high time they are celebrated for this fact.’", "answer": ["One in seven people who are in employment work for themselves .\nBank of England said 'large numbers' had set up their own businesses .\nThe rise was particularly noticeable among women to juggle childcare .\nThe Bank also noted a rise in number of over 65 'silver entrepreneurs'"], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "(CNN)Another one for the \"tourists behaving badly\" file. Two American women have reportedly been arrested for carving their initials into a wall with a coin inside Rome's Colosseum. Daily Italian newspaper La Stampa says the women, aged 21 and 25, were spotted carrying out the act by fellow tourists, who then told security. The two letters -- J and N -- were about eight inches in length and scratched on a brick wall at the historic Roman amphitheater. The women, both from California, reportedly snapped a selfie of themselves with their initials before they were arrested. Their names have not been released. The American pair may now face a fine for \"aggravated damage\" on a building of historical and artistic interest. If one Russian's experience is anything to go by, the price won't be cheap. Last November, authorities in Rome slapped a 20,000-euro ($21,685) penalty on a Russian tourist caught carving his name into the famed landmark. The 42-year-old man was apprehended after a guard at the Colosseum saw him carve the letter \"K\" in a section of brickwork. After police caught up with him, the man was found guilty of causing aggravated damage, fined and given a four-month suspended sentence. The Russian was one of five tourists caught carving graffiti on Colosseum walls in 2014. The earlier incidents involved two Australians -- a father and son -- and a Canadian and a Brazilian, both teenagers. Rome isn't alone in having to deal with inappropriate tourist behavior this month. Egypt is now looking into reports that one of its most historic sites was the backdrop for a Russian porn flick. According to Al Arabiya News, authorities have confirmed that an X-rated film was shot next to the Pyramids of Giza and the Sphinx and are now investigating. The video was reportedly made by Russian tourists, who then uploaded it to the Internet nine months ago. Al Arabiya reports that Minister of Antiquities Mamdouh al-Demati says the issue has been referred to the public prosecutor and new surveillance cameras are being installed in the area. The incident comes as a reminder that no world landmark is safe from the salacious urges of tourists -- no matter how sacred it might be to the locals. Cambodia's Angkor Archeological Park experienced its own string of nudity-related incidents this year. In February, U.S. tourists and sisters Lindsey Kate Adams and Leslie Jan Adams were deported after allegedly getting caught taking partially nude photos at Preah Khan temple, one of the sacred sites inside Cambodia's Angkor complex. They received six-month suspended prison sentences, a one-million riel ($250) fine and were banned from entering the country for four years. In January, a group of photos featuring a topless dancer leaning against the ruins surfaced on Facebook. Early last year, Peru officials were forced to respond to a chain of \"naked tourism\" incidents at Machu Picchu, also a World Heritage Site. They detained four American tourists, two Canadians and two Australians for stripping down for pictures at the site.

{"question": "There were famous faces in the best seats in the house as optimism over a new era abounded. John Greig, officially the Greatest Ever Ranger, was by Dave King’s side in the director’s box in a highly symbolic return to Ibrox. He was joined by one of the club’s greatest ever managers, Walter Smith, and John Brown, who can lay claim to some of the greatest ever declamations against the ousted boardroom regime. Rangers midfielder Haris Vuckic, on loan from Newcastle, celebrates putting the home side ahead at Ibrox . Young Queen of the South striker Aidan Smith (centre) wheels away to celebrate after scoring a late leveller . The greatness, somewhat predictably, stopped at the white lines of the pitch. This ramshackle group of players looked like they might just let the feelgood factor flourish when Newcastle loanee Haris Vuckic put them ahead with 12 minutes remaining. There would not, however, be the delicious irony of one of Mike Ashley’s men allowing King and Co a victory to savour in their first home match since seizing control. All the failings that have left the Ibrox side in the midst of a Championship play-off scrap they may well not win came to the fore as 17-year-old Aidan Smith – making just his second senior appearance - equalised for Queens eight minutes later. In truth, it was a point they more than merited. Jeers rang out at the final whistle as supporters who flocked back to Ibrox to financially support the new board digested yet another on-field setback. The grim sequence of results now reads as just one win in their last seven outings. For King and his associates, the question of what can be done to lift a desperately flagging season remains highly pertinent. Discussions with caretaker manager Kenny McDowall will have to determine whether he continues or whether an alternative interim appointment is made for the remainder of the campaign. This was not the first time this season that Queens had found themselves featuring in a significant day in the Rangers saga. Back on December 12, their comprehensive 2-0 victory at Palmerston Park became almost an addendum to news that Ally McCoist had handed in his notice. For the visiting support inside the Dumfries ground, it was yet another bewildering development to try and digest. Rangers legend John Greig was in the stands at Ibrox for Tuesday night's Scottish Championship clash . Events tumbled even quicker from then, through McCoist’s gardening leave, an AGM, crisis loan offers and boardroom resignations, finally reaching the regime change arrived at with last Friday’s EGM. Somewhere in the middle of the jumble was the SFA’s refusal, on Christmas Eve of all days, to allow Ashley to increase his shareholding. It was one of several, crucial turning points on the exceptionally winding road towards a fresh start for a club bruised and battered over the previous four years. The desperation of supporters to grasp this moment, for those who stayed away to return to supporting their team, was palpable. Some had purchased half-season tickets in the wake of the EGM, despite some of the included matches having already passed. Last night, routes around Ibrox were congested in fashion often unfamiliar this season. The stadium wasn’t full, but the 35,018 here was still the highest crowd recorded since the opening day of the season. Anyone purchasing a programme on their way in was greeted by a cover showing King with his arms around John Gilligan and Paul Murray, happily posing within the trophy room. Enthusiasm was everywhere. The question, of course, was how long it would last when confronted by the paucity of the Rangers team. Given the boos that rang out at half-time, the answer could be given as approximately 45 minutes. Fresh from a dispiriting 0-0 draw with Cowdenbeath at the weekend, McDowall’s side had actually made a pretty positive start – as if feeding off the renewed energy. Nicky Law picked out Nicky Clark with a nice cutback and the striker drilled narrowly wide from the edge of the area. Not long after, Clark was unable to generate sufficient power or direction in a header. Yet their best chance of the opening period fell to the other front man in McDowall’s 4-4-2. It was woefully spurned. Vuckic fashioned the opportunity by cutting in field to hit a deflected drive that was pushed out by Zander Clark in the Queens goal. Daly looked odds-on to polish things off but spooned the rebound over the bar on the slide. Vuckic celebrates hos goal with substitute Bilel Mohsni (left), Nicky Clark and Darren McGregor . Queens had shown a nice degree of composure in midfield and steadily began to assert themselves. Slowly but surely, the atmosphere changed. When Law was robbed on the fringe of the area by Kevin Holt after 34 minutes, the first real roar of frustration arrived. By that point, the visitors could already have been ahead. Lee McCulloch missed a defensive header to allow Gavin Reilly in behind him. He picked out Michael Paton, whose neatly-struck effort beat Lee Robinson but rebounded off the goalkeeper’s right-hand post. Ibrox heaved a sigh of relief. But it was not the last first-half scare. When Robinson was forced into evasive action to deny a fine Iain Russell strike, the loose ball spun towards Reilly. He couldn’t adjust his body quickly enough to head below the bar from around six yards out. Daly looped one wide from a Lee Wallace cross after the restart but that wasn’t the signal for a Rangers bombardment. A change was needed if a resolute and sparky Queens side weren’t going to spoil the party. One finally arrived from McDowall in the 65th minute when young Andy Murdoch was replaced by the even younger Tom Walsh. The 18-year-old at least injected a little more pace and energy to proceedings. It seemed as though Rangers had finally sneaked a winner after 78 minutes. Vuckic got a touch to a ball delivered from the left before Clark practically stumbled into it. It broke back to the Newcastle loanee who calmly angled a shot into the far corner of the net. This is, however, a team riven with weaknesses. And they were exposed yet again when Queens claimed a leveller they deserved with just four minutes to play. Bilel Mohsni – just on four minutes earlier after Lee Wallace was hurt – was typically wayward with a bungled attempt at a clearance that looped to Daniel Carmichael. He delivered into the middle, where Robinson expertly saved from Paton. There was, though, to be no denying teenager Smith, who was left with a simple finish into an exposed net.", "answer": ["Haris Vuckic put Rangers ahead against Queen of the South on Tuesday .\nQueen of the South striker Aidan Smith scored late equaliser .\nRangers legend John Greig was at Ibrox for the Championship fixture ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "Dressed in jumpsuits, hands in cuffs, or locked away in tiny cells, these are the youths held by America's juvenile justice system. The emotional portraits, taken at three 'school' facilities around Washington state, show the inmates standing in prison corridors and resting in their rooms - as well as others which simply try to show how they are feeling.

However, while Davis, whose images are due to be published in an upcoming book, focused on the prisoners' human side for his series, he deliberately left out one aspect: their pasts.

{"question": "An Alabama woman charged in her granddaughter's running death testified Wednesday that she would 'rather die' than hurt the little girl, and denied making her run as punishment. Joyce Hardin Garrard took the witness stand to say she never intended any harm to 9-year-old Savannah Hardin. When defense attorney Richard Rhea asked if she would have done anything to hurt Savannah or any other grandchildren, Garrard replied, 'I'd rather die first.' The 49-year-old Garrard said she and Savannah had been in the yard picking up sticks and talking, taking frequent breaks to get a drink of water and to play. She said she was telling Savannah the importance of not lying. Took the stand: Joyce Garrard, 49, took the stand in her own defense Wednesday in her trial for allegedly killing her 10-year-old granddaughter Savannah Hardin by forcing her to run as punishment for lying about eating candy . 'I was picking up sticks with her because I felt just as responsible for her lying as she was,' Garrard testified. Prosecutors say Garrard killed the girl three years ago by making her run as punishment for a lie about candy. 'It was 'more like a jog and not a run,' Garrard maintained. Garrard said Savannah was such an active child, the only way to hold her attention was to keep her moving. 'We was hooting and hollering, fussing back and forth,' Garrard said. Garrard said they picked up sticks for about 40 minutes, but spent much of the day in the yard. She said Savannah told her she had to go to the bathroom and they were racing into the house when the girl fell backward. Garrard said that's when she told Savannah's stepmother, Jessica Mae Hardin, to call 911. 'Did you have some intent to hurt Savannah?' Rhea asked. 'Not that day or any other day,' Garrard replied. Victim: Garrad allegedly forced her granddaughter, Savannah Hardin (pictured left and right), 9, to run to her death at her home in Etowah County in 2012 after discovering she had lied about eating forbidden chocolates . Arrests: Garrard (pictured, left, in her police mugshot) was charged in the fatal February 2012 incident alongside Savannah's stepmother, 27-year-old Jessica Mae Hardin (right) One word on a 911 recording could help decide Garrard's fate. With 9-year-old Savannah lying unconscious following an afternoon of running and a 911 operator listening over the phone, Joyce Hardin Garrard asked for something — either a cigarette or a blanket. The request, depending on exactly what she said, could be considered callousness or compassion. On the Feb. 17, 2012, recording, played in court Tuesday, Garrard is heard in the background as the girl's stepmother, Jessica Mae Hardin, talked for more than 11 minutes with Lori Beth Beggs, a 911 operator in Etowah County. 'My daughter had a seizure,' Hardin says at the beginning. Speaking in a loud voice as Hardin talks to Beggs, Garrard is heard repeatedly saying the child's name and asking her to wake up. 'Savannah. Savannah,' Garrard says in a steady voice. 'Savannah, open your eyes.' Then, nearly three minutes into the recording, with Savannah still unresponsive, Garrard makes a request. 'Give me a smoke,' Beggs testified the woman said. The defense maintains she said: 'Give me a throw,' referring to a small blanket. While jurors have listened to the recording, Circuit Judge Billy Ogletree refused to let them see a transcript of the audio prepared for the defense. What the jurors believe she said could be vital. If Garrard asked for a cigarette while the girl lay before her dying, jurors could agree with prosecutors that the woman was angry and meant to kill the child by running her for hours. If they believe the woman said 'throw,' jurors could see that as sign Garrard was worried and trying to help the girl. Other testimony showed that the girl was wrapped in a small blanket when firefighters and paramedics arrived. Scene: Gerrard allegedly made her granddaughter carry sticks of wood as she ran to her death at her home (pictured). But defense lawyers are expected to argue that the third-grader's death wasn't Gerrard's fault . Prosecutors were preparing to cross-examine Garrard later Wednesday after she was questioned by her attorney. Garrard faces a death sentence or life without parole if convicted of capital murder. The girl's stepmother is awaiting trial on a murder charge in the girl's death. Authorities said she sat by without intervening while the older woman forced the girl to run until she dropped. A defense expert said in dramatic testimony Tuesday that he wouldn't classify the death of a young girl as a homicide even though her grandmother is accused of running her to death, yet he agreed the child wouldn't have died without exhausting physical exertion. Questioned by an attorney for Garrard at her capital murder trial, forensic pathologist Dr. James Lauridson indicated he couldn't say someone else caused the death of Savannah Hardin, 9. 'Knowing what I know I would not have called this a homicide, I would have called it indeterminate,' said Lauridson, retired chief medical examiner for Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences. Lauridson also disagreed with autopsy findings that concluded the girl suffered from heat exhaustion and dehydration. Lauridson — using water, dye and a plastic skull to demonstrate sodium deficiency — said the girl was actually over-hydrated and had no signs of heat illness. Mother and daughter: Savannah (pictured with her mother in a Facebook photo) eventually collapsed and started seizing. She was rushed to a nearby hospital, where she later died from dehydration and low sodium . Jurors paid close attention to Lauridson, standing and craning their necks to follow his testimony. Garrard began crying after he said her granddaughter's death wasn't a homicide. But under cross-examination by prosecutor Marcus Reid, Lauridson admitted he didn't have all the witness statements and police files that were available to Dr. Emily Ward, the state pathologist who ruled that the girl's death was a homicide. Her decision was crucial to the decision to charge Garrard. Neighbors have testified they saw the 49-year-old Boaz woman forcing the girl to keep running even after she was vomiting and begging to stop, and Reid drove home the point to jurors. 'It was running that killed her. Isn't that right?' Reid asked Lauridson. 'Yes,' Lauridson replied. Lauridson's testimony built upon that of former forensic investigator Chris Crow, who helped Ward with the post-mortem investigation of Savannah's death. Crow testified that a report indicated Ward didn't have the girl's medical records before conducting the autopsy. The final autopsy report wasn't completed until weeks after Garrard already had been indicted, he said. Crow said the autopsy took Ward only an hour, which he described as 'pretty quick' for such an examination. But Crow testified under cross-examination that Ward was more experienced than other pathologists in her office, possibly accounting for her speed, and Ward was in a meeting where authorities detailed their evidence. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against Garrard, who is accused of making the girl run for hours as punishment for a lie about candy on Feb. 17, 2012.

They had a similar chance a year ago — although they didn’t play last — but blew it badly in Rome. The common language of coaches in this position is ‘let’s win the game first,’ but that is nonsense. This is not about beating France, it is about winning the title. They need a clear game plan to maximise points difference. Nobody remembers who comes second. Chris Robshaw's England will know exactly what they have to do to win the Six Nations when they kick off . Luther Burrell breaks with the ball during the England captain's run at Twickenham . It is tempting to think England must throw caution to the wind and play a wild, attacking game. But if they get ahead of themselves and try to run up a big score early they could come horribly unstuck. This is not a bad French team — in fact I have never really seen a bad French team as they do have so much talent available. They don’t look comfortable on or off the field but the French have a habit of performing under pressure and they’re capable of beating England. Throughout this week, I would have gone through match scenarios with my captain, the scrum-halves and the fly-halves, discussing what decision we’d make depending on how many points we need in the match. That would then be presented to the whole team so everyone is on message. England's players gather as head coach Stuart Lancaster looks on during the captain's run . Jonathan Joseph passes the ball during the England captain's run ahead of the game with France . Lancaster must make it clear to his players exactly what they need to do to win the title . If England need a big score, Chris Robshaw and the half-backs will face big decisions from the first minute. I hope Stuart Lancaster has made it clear to the players this week exactly how the day will pan out in terms of timings. As soon as the early games finish, the results should be up on the changing-room wall. The amount of points they need to win by should be printed in big, bold type. This is the day for real detail and no surprises, and finding out which players can really perform under pressure. England should be very pleased with the situation they find themselves in, especially after the hiding they received in Dublin. With the games falling as they do, I wouldn’t set out any directives for the team about watching them or not — it should be every individual’s decision. Personally, I would like to watch as much as possible; if nothing else, it takes your mind off our game for a few minutes. Some of the players may want to watch the Wales v Italy game while others won’t. They’ll be warming up while the Scotland v Ireland game is being played so there’s no question of them watching that, but I’d let the players know I would be putting the score from the Ireland game up on the board in the changing room at 4.30pm so they know precisely what’s required of them. That can be broken down into six very clear areas. 1 Build the score . It sounds easy, but it’s critical. France are more susceptible than any international side if they are put under pressure and they have lost on their last three visits to Twickenham. The best way to create pressure is to lead throughout. So England must try to ensure they take the lead early and force France to chase the game. They must take every penalty that is offered — if the referee, say, gives an advantage, decline it and take the points. Take three points from drop-goal opportunities — never leave their 22 without points. Joseph scores England's first try against Scotland and they must build a score against France . This game is crying out for three drop goals in the first 20 minutes, even if you don’t score tries until later in the game. If opportunities arise, we must take them, something we failed to do against Scotland. 2 Maintain discipline . England must be squeaky clean and aim to concede no more than four penalties in each half. The contact area and scrum will be key and England cannot afford to gift France easy points. Scrum-half Ben Youngs needs to establish a running dialogue with referee Nigel Owens and England must not allow France to have the ball at the breakdown. Yellow or red cards must be seen as a total disaster, and every player must take full responsibility to control himself in every aspect of the game. Scrum half Ben Youngs needs to establish a running dialogue with referee Nigel Owens . 3 Keep the ball in play . The speed of the ball and the speed and variety of the restarts are absolutely critical. I want to see quick, pre-called line-outs and the ball in and out of the scrum quickly to avoid the risk of giving penalties away at the back of it. If the line-out isn’t secure, there’s nothing wrong with taking the tap penalty. Keep the tempo up because this massive French side will not want to be moved around. George Ford passes the ball and England must keep the ball in play as much as possible . Also, to score maximum points, you need the ball in play for the maximum amount of time. Every time the ball’s out of play, it is not only time but points ticking away. England must also employ an exciting restart policy. Every kick-off must be done with the aim of getting the ball back. We need variety so we can kick left, right or down the middle but we must get it back. 4 Kick well, chase hard . This is a huge test of England’s tactical kicking game, which I’m not sure is as good as it needs to be yet. In the 2003 World Cup semi-final, I picked Mike Catt at No 12 ahead of Mike Tindall because he had a superior kicking game. France will believe they can get at George Ford so Mike Brown needs to support his kicking game. Mike Brown needs to support Ford's kicking game and limit the up-and-unders . I’d limit the up-and-unders and box kicks, too, as they are too much of a lottery. Ford, Youngs and Brown need to look deep and hit the green stuff. Field position gave Jonny Wilkinson the opportunity to get three drop goals as England won that semi 24-7 against a French team who were favourites to beat us. 5 Half-Time . The message needs to be that this is now a game of 40 minutes. You can’t change what’s happened in the first half but you can learn. They’ll know exactly what is needed and the team and tactics can change if needs be. The bench can then be used to identify areas of French weakness and attack them. England must make sure the second half is played as a game of 40 minutes . Understand, France are currently the best defensive team in the tournament, having only conceded two tries. Patience will be a key word, but tries will come as long as we are playing the game at real pace. 6 Keep your best men on . Matches are won in the last 30 minutes, not the first 30, and I’d always look to have my strongest side on the field at the end of the game. The key is not to bring any player on unless he is going to improve the team. I still believe Danny Cipriani can be a trump card. Will Lancaster dare opt for a Ford-Cipriani-Joseph combination if the game calls for it? You can score two tries in the last five minutes; it only takes 20 seconds to score. Danny Cipriani can be England's trump card coming off the bench . I’d expect England to win — then it becomes about by how much. I just feel this French side is better than everyone is giving them credit for, and I’m very surprised Lancaster has not picked a specialist second-row on the bench. It’s a massive gamble as Courtney Lawes and Geoff Parling have a history of injuries, potentially leaving Nick Easter to play the majority of the match out of position in the second row. This is a hugely exciting day of rugby. People have questioned the staggered kick-off times but for me it makes the day unbelievably exciting and is brilliant for fans watching at home. It is a massive day for Lancaster and his team. They need this championship more than the others. They can’t afford another bad day at the office.", "answer": ["England play France in the final game of the Six Nations and will know exactly what they have to do to win the tournament .\nEngland must aim to win the Six Nations title and not just beat France .\nEngland were in a similar position last year and failed to win the title ."], "label": "SUM"}

A report said that due to the way the body had frozen hospital staff were unable to remove it from its compartment in time to make the deadline for the funeral service. Eventually the freezer had to be turned off to allow time for the body to thaw out so that it could be removed and a funeral was held later.

A King's College Hospital spokesperson said: 'It is vital that deceased patients are treated with dignity and respect when under our care. 'We informed the patient's family when we became aware of this incident, and apologised for any distress caused. We have introduced new procedures to prevent this from happening again, and are undertaking a review of our mortuary facilities.' The incident at Kings College Hospital, in London, was one of 87 incidents last year recorded by the Human Tissue Authority where there was a mishap with a dead body. In gruesome blunder uncovered at Warwick Hospital a body was found to contain the brain from another patient which had been put inside the body by mistake after a post mortem examination. A bewildered funeral director spotted the error as he realised his body's brain had not been removed so the extra organ had to belong to another person. Eventually the mix-up was sorted out and the brain was put back in the body it had been taken from. At Southampton General Hospital there was an incident where all the spaces in the deep freeze were taken up so a body was put in a body bag and placed in a fridge.

{"question": "Jamie Oliver has re-ignited his feud with fellow celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay by accusing him of being 'deeply jealous' of his success. The 39-year-old hit out at his Scottish rival after Ramsay criticised him for not attending the opening of his new restaurant - Jamie's Italian - in Hong Kong. Ramsay, 48, who previously opened his own Bread Street Kitchen in the Asian city, said Oliver could have 'at least turned up' to unveil his new eatery. Scroll down for video . Jamie Oliver (left) has hit out at fellow celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay, claiming he is 'deeply jealous' of his success. It comes after Ramsay criticised Oliver for not attending the Hong Kong opening of his restaurant . Oliver responded to the comments during a visit to open a new restaurant in Sydney, Australia, this week by claiming Ramsay was simply jealous. He said: 'Gordon will do anything to try and take the p**s out of me because he is deeply jealous and can't quite work out why I do what I do and why he can't do that. 'He is too busy shouting and screaming and making our industry look like a bunch of shouters and screamers.' Oliver and his wife Jules have seen their fortune leap £90million to in excess of £240million with their restaurant chains, TV appearances and her childrenswear range. Meanwhile Ramsay's fortune is said to be valued at more than £100million with his worldwide chain of restaurants. The pair have often made snide comments at each other, and it didn't stop this week when Oliver continued to criticise his rival over their books. Oliver's 15th book, Save With Jamie, shot to the top of the UK bestsellers list upon its release, bringing his total number of book sales to just over 37million. In contrast, Ramsay has released 21 titles which have sold an estimate three million copies in total. Oliver said: 'I think that really, really annoys him. Ramsay is currently in the U.S. with his wife Tana and four daughters (pictured at the Kids' Choice Awards) Jamie and Jools Oliver have an estimated combined fortune of more than £240million from their ventures . 'Book sales are about having a deep trusted relationship with the public. I really write my books. I don't just turn up for the front cover. I write every word, every letter and I oversee every bit of design. 'You can sell a few books by luck or a moment ... but not 15 years and 37million books. That's not luck.' The two celebrity chefs - who both have four children - have previously clashed over their differing styles. In 2010, while on a promotional tour of Canada, Ramsay said Oliver was 'just a cook' while he proclaimed himself to be 'a chef'. A year earlier, he admitted he was not a fan of Oliver, describing him as a 'one-pot wonder.' He said: 'Everything kind of gets mixed in - hands in. It's a very different style to me. He sticks it in the oven, comes back three hours later and it's done. Chefs Oliver and Ramsay (pictured together in 2006) have often exchanged fraught words over the years . Oliver made the comments during an appearance in Sydney, Australia, to open a new restaurant this week . 'We cook differently. I use basic ingredients taken up with a lot more excitement. 'But competition is healthy. It's good to have that kind of rivalry.' He also asked when he had last complained about a meal and answered: 'Last time I had dinner at Jamie Oliver's restaurant.' But Oliver has continued to stand his ground, and even praised the wife of Ramsay's wife Tana.

{"question": "George Osborne today refused to match Labour's pledge not to increase VAT as a row erupted over how to balance the books after the election. The Chancellor declined to give a 'cast-iron guarantee' to match Labour's pledge not to increase VAT over the five years of the next Parliament. It came after Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls that Conservatives had a history of raising VAT after elections despite saying they had no plans to do so during the campaign. Scroll down for video . Chancellor George Osborne declined to give a 'cast-iron guarantee' to match Labour's pledge not to increase VAT from 20 per cent over the five years of the next Parliament . Appearing before the Commons Treasury Committee, Mr Osborne was repeatedly challenged to match Labour's promise but refused to do so . Labour today unveiled a new poster warning of Tory VAT hikes after the election. The headline rate of VAT stands at 20 per cent after Mr Osborne increased it from 17.5 per cent in his emergency Budget in 2010. Mr Balls claimed that another rise after the election on May was 'the only way the Tories can make their sums add up'. Launching a new Labour poster, Mr Balls said: 'We will make our tax commitments in full in our manifesto. But I am clear that while millionaires have been given a huge tax cut, working people are paying more in tax after the last five years of the Tories. 'So, today, I can announce a clear pledge to the British people. The next Labour government will not raise VAT. And we will not extend it to food, children's clothes, books, newspapers and public transport fares. 'We will not raise VAT because it's the tax that hits everyone. It's the tax that hits you every day. And it hits pensioners and the poorest hardest.' In the Houses of Parliament today, Mr Osborne was repeatedly challenged to match the promise but refused to do so. Labour MP John Mann asked the Chancellor four times to give a 'cast-iron guarantee' that he would not hike the tax. A second Labour MP, Andy Love, also twice pressed the Chancellor over whether VAT would have to rise. Labour's shadow chancellor unveiled a new poster warning 'the Tories will raise VAT' to help balance the books . In his responses, Mr Osborne said he did not intend to increase the tax but stopped short of an actual pledge to rule it out. He told Mr Love: 'I have identified where the £30 billion of savings I believe need to come from and they don't involve a VAT rise. 'The question for those who say they are going to try to balance the books but say it mainly has to be done through tax, as the official Opposition does, has to spell out what those big tax rises are. 'And it's pretty clear today that they have opened to door to a big increase in National Insurance and the `jobs tax' and I think it would be very, very damaging for this country.' To Mr Mann, the Chancellor said: 'We don't need to increase VAT. I couldn't be clearer. We do not need to increase VAT because our plans involve saving money on the welfare budget and Government departments.' In a jibe at Mr Osborne's former membership of an Oxford University dining club, the Labour MP retorted: 'Your answers are more Bullingdon than Bassetlaw. In Bassetlaw, we like straight John Bull.' And reviving memories of Mr Osborne's 'omnishambles budget' of 2012, he offered the Chancellor a Gregg's pasty to give him the strength to respond more fully. Mr Balls claimed the Tories 'have a secret plan to raise VAT again' But Mr Osborne stuck to his position: 'The policies we have do not involve a VAT rise ... Our proposals, our spending plans, our policies, do not involve tax rises. They don't therefore involve a VAT rise. However, your proposals do involve tax increases. You have been quite open about that. That means it is either VAT or jobs tax or income tax. 'That's what people will get if they vote Labour. But of course they won't vote Labour because they remember what you did last time.' Mr Mann retorted: 'The pasty-eaters will beware again.' Mr Balls, who believes Gordon Brown's refusal to accept his calls for a pledge not to raise VAT contributed to Labour's defeat in 2010, said he would 'resign rather than break this promise'. Speaking in Birmingham - in front of a new poster featuring the letters VAT as concrete blocks with the slogan 'Don't let the Tories hit you with this' - Mr Balls said the unannounced rise from 17.5 per cent to 20 per cent after the 2010 election had cost families an average £1,800 over four years. It was put up 'despite David Cameron telling the British people a few days before the election that he had 'no plans' to do so and despite the promises of Nick Clegg', he said - and had been raised by every Conservative administration for 40 years. 'Now history is repeating itself all over again. It's the same Tory lie about VAT: 1979, 1992, 2010 and now 2015. 'Everybody in the country knows what it means: the Tories have a secret plan to raise VAT again.' Treasury figures suggested a rise to 22.5% would cost a family with children an average of GBP450 a year and a pensioner couple GBP275 a year, he said - something a Labour administration would not allow. A Conservative spokesman said: 'Ed Miliband and Ed Balls have repeatedly said they will raise taxes. It is time that they came clean with the British public about which taxes they will raise - income tax or national insurance? 'The choice at this election is becoming clearer by the day: sticking with the competence of the Conservatives' long-term economic plan that's securing a better future for Britain or abandoning that plan with hard-working taxpayers paying the price for the economic chaos that would result from Ed Miliband in Downing Street.' Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said: 'Labour have no credibility on the economy. Ed Balls might be ruling out a rise in VAT but he can't rule out a rise in National Insurance and already plans to hike corporation tax. 'Because the Liberal Democrats have taken the difficult decisions to stick to a balanced recovery, under our future plans there is no need to raise income tax, National Insurance, VAT or corporation tax.'", "answer": ["Labour's Ed Balls unveils poster warning Tories will hike VAT again .\nOsborne used first Budget in 2010 to increase rate from 17.5% to 20% .\nChancellor insists his plans to balance books do not require new increase .\nBut he repeatedly refused to match Labour's promise ahead of election ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "John Bilardi is paralysed with an unbearable sense of guilt as he tries to make any sense of what would possess his son, now known as Jihadi Jake, to volunteer to sacrifice his own young life for the Islamic State. On the surface Jake Bilardi was far from what is perceived as a stereotypical recruit for an extremist Islamic group: a white boy from suburban Australia who, as the youngest of six children, had an atheist upbringing. However, even his father admits you didn't have to dig too deep to see that his 18 year-old son was a troubled soul and now he will live with a life of immense regret. Scroll down for video . Jake Bilardi's father John (pictured left) has spoken to 60 Minutes about his son's decision to join an extremist Islamic group . Although no one could have foreseen that the loner, who turned his back on the real world, was living a secret second life locked away in his bedroom in Melbourne on the internet for the past 18 months as he slowly but surely assumed his new persona as Abu Abdullah al-Australi. The painfully shy boy had never been happier after converting to Muslim and regularly attending mosques but his new lifestyle choice did not end there as he flew to the Middle East in December which ultimately cost him his life  in a failed suicide mission in Iraq last week. His father struggled to find any words to describe his pain and overwhelming sense of guilt when he spoke to 60 Minutes reporter Michael Usher which airs on Sunday night. 'He is at a complete loss to try to understand any of it - he's trying to put the picture together now on not a lot of information at all to be honest - he is learning as much as anyone else is learning in the public forum,' Usher told Daily Mail Australia. John finds it even more difficult to comprehend that his son had plans to orchestrate what would have been a deliberate act of mass murder right in his very own city where he had lived his whole life. Jake's father shared pictures and cards with the programme, showing a Happy Father's Day cars with the words 'I Love You' written inside . Jake's father admitted to 60 Minutes reporter Michael Usher (pictured right) that you didn't have to dig very far to realise that the 18-year-old was a very troubled soul . 'He can barely talk about it all he struggles for words with the fact that his son had plan B which was to commit a major act of terror in Melbourne and had begun buying the chemicals for the bombs before he disappeared out of Australia,' Usher said. As the youngest of six children, Jake had an atheist upbringing . 'That atrocity John can not understand at all - the family are desperately trying to now go back and understand who Jake was because he wasn't the kid they thought he was and tragically all of the warning signs were there of a kid in trouble.' When Usher suggested there were clear warning signs that his son had issues, John agreed saying: 'yes they were and I'm so sorry I didn't do anything about it.' 'He said he was at times very difficult emotionally - even as a little boy,' Usher said. 'He also said \"I'm sorry I wish i could have done more to understand my son and stop him\" and he's finding it very hard to grieve because he's feeling so much guilt,' Usher said. ISIS leaked a photograph of 18-year-old Australian Jake Bilardi (pictured) in the vehicle he allegedly blew himself up in while driving it . To add to Jake's complexities, his mother died from cancer in 2012 and was then looked after by his five older siblings as his parents had divorced years earlier. His father described his son as an 'extremely shy' loner who felt alienated from his family and even expressed in one of his blogs that he felt unsafe with his siblings. He said he felt he should have known about the full extent of his son's bullying. 'I wish I could understand more of what went on,' he told Usher. But John also feels that his son was brainwashed and believes that he was a 'soft target for' the Islamic recruiters. Bilardi (pictured, left) in a school photo from Year 10 - the year he converted to Islam, according to school friends, and  wearing a Chelsea Football Club shirt (pictured right) Jake Bilardi's father feels a deep regret that he didn't address his son's issues when he was a child . His former fellow pupils also described Jake as a loner who walked around with his hands in his pockets and spoke seriously all of time about Middle Eastern politics. Although it was unusual that the child from an atheist background converted to Muslim there was nothing to suggest that he was acting radically in his public life but online he was in active contact with Islamic State recruiters. Jake organised to get a passport and told his family he wanted to work at a charity in Uganda. 'He went online from writing about his love of soccer and wanting to buy a dog to children allowed to join the jihad and I cant wait for my pilgrimage to Mecca in December,' Usher said. The last time John ever saw his son was when he asked for his birth certificate in order to get a passport and said he seemed uncharacteristically 'upbeat'. 'He said he was articulate and clear and seemed happy and in fact in the last communications he seemed very content and he said to his dad \"I feel comfort being a Muslim and I feel comfort in Islam\", Usher said. 'John was optimistic that his son was on a good path that after the divorce and feeling alienated he thought that his son had found some happiness and peace.' However, these feelings were short-lived as John had a growing concern for his son's welfare by the last time he ever heard from Jake again in the form of a Facebook message when was in the Middle East. Footage of Jake being bullied at school - his former school mates described him as as a loner who walked around with his hands in his pockets . The last time his father saw Jake he was uncharacteristically 'upbeat' 'The message was pretty veiled other than to say that he was in the region and had some intent,' Usher said. John was understandably panicked but couldn't find a lot of places to turn to get help and was at a great loss at what to do. 'In fact even at that point, there was still some disbelieving that maybe this was just some great romantic notion of Jake's and he was off some ridiculous journey,' Usher said. 'Then he couldn't contact him and had no further communication from him and John learned of his son's death as it appeared in the media last week.' John send a warning out to all parents to be more aware about who their children are interacting with online. John was optimistic that his son was on a good path and had finally found happiness and peace . Jake's father warns all parents to take note of who their children are interacting with online . 'It's going on, it's happening, it's real it's not just from a Muslim background, it's anybody they can find, any soft target they will aim, human life means nothing to them,' John told Usher. 'I could tell he was brainwashed but they are such a powerful influence.' His father never wants to hear again the words that his son will be forever known as -  'Jihadi Jake'  but instead hold onto the memory of his beloved son. 'He's trying to preserve a little bit of who the Jake was that he knew and loved - the kid who loved soccer, the kid who used to run around in the backyard and play in the park with his dad . 'He said that's the Jake I need to remember - Jihadi Jake I don't even want to hear that name because I don't even know who that person is and that's not my son.'

{"question": "A new report is claiming that it was a member of Hillary Clinton's own party who leaked to the press that the political heavyweight was using a personal email address during her time as Secretary of State. The New York Post is reporting that Valerie Jarrett, one of President Barack Obama's top advisers, leaked details of the story to the press through outside sources hoping it would not trace back to the White House. What's more, the entire thing was timed to become public just as Clinton was planning to announce her candidacy for president. Scroll down for video . A new report claims that it was a member of Hillary Clinton's (above) own party who leaked to the press that the political heavyweight was using a personal email address during her time as Secretary of State . Valerie Jarrett (left), one of President Barack Obama's (right) top advisers, leaked details of the story to the press through outside sources hoping it would not trace back to the White House . The story ran in the New York Post and was written by Ed Klein, who spoke last Wednesday about his belief Jarrett was involved on Fox and Friends . 'Obama and Valerie Jarrett will go to any lengths to prevent Hillary from becoming president,' said a source close to the White House. 'They believe that Hillary, like her husband, is left of center, not a true-blue liberal.' Sources claim that the long rumored tension between Obama and the Clintons hit a high when during the midterm elections many members of the party refused to be seen campaigning with President Obama. Jarrett is reported to have commented this was because the Clintons had begun 'marginalizing the president' and that they were 'trying to wrestle control of the Democratic Party away from Obama.' Because of this she reportedly went out of her way to exact revenge, working to get Monica Lewinsky high profile press opportunities and frequently complaining about the Clintons. Then, shortly after the midterm elections, she, President Obama and Michelle Obama had Clinton in for a meeting and reportedly told her in no uncertain words that they planned on remaining neutral during the presidential primary should she run for president. This as Jarrett has reportedly been speaking to Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland, and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts about possibly running in the 2016 election. 'She’s promised O’Malley and Warren the full support of the White House if they will challenge Hillary for the presidential nomination,' said a source. Jarrett has reportedly been speaking to Martin O’Malley (above), the former governor of Maryland, about running in 2016 . She has also reportedly reached out to Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts about entering the primary . Edward Klein, the author of Blood Feud: The Clintons vs. the Obamas, also spoke to a friend of the Clintons, who told him that Bill said; 'My contacts and friends in newspapers and TV tell me that they’ve been contacted by the White House and offered all kinds of negative stories about us.' He then added; 'The Obamas are behind the e-mail story, and they’re spreading rumors that I’ve been with women, that Hillary promoted people at the State Department who’d done favors for our foundation, that John Kerry had to clean up diplomatic messes Hillary left behind.' It seems like it is not over yet either, as there are reportedly six more probes currently going on that are looking into Clinton's performance. Bill, upon learning of this, reportedly said to a friend; 'The Obamas are out to get us any way they can.' Klein seems to have known about all this for some time, discussing it when he appeared on Fox and Friends last Wednesday. '[Bill] has said, according to my sources, that the White House is leaking to their friends in the mainstream media stories about the Clintons. Not only about Hillary, but about him, and about what she did while she was in the State Department,' said Klein. 'This is from sources within the White House, that the Clintons know that Hillary is under not one, but six different investigations prompted by the White House.' He then added; 'They're going through these, looking for problems on her expense account, on her dealings with foreign leaders. All of this, I'm told, is prompted by Valerie Jarrett and the president, who do not want to see Hillary Clinton become President of the United States.' Jarrett, 58, is one of President Obama’s longest serving advisers and closest confidantes, and said in a recent interview that she would stay in the White House 'until the lights go off.'", "answer": ["A new report claims that Valerie Jarrett, one of President Barack Obama's top advisers, leaked the Hillary Clinton email scandal to the press .\nWhat's more, the leak was reportedly planned to hit at the same time Clinton planned to announce her run for presidency .\nThe New York Post claims that Jarrett was angry that the Clintons had been working to 'marginalize' President Obama .\nJarrett reportedly blamed the Clintons for the fact that members of the party refused to campaign with Obama during the midterm elections .\nThere are reportedly six more probes going on investigating Clinton and more leaks are expected .\nPresident Obama reportedly told Clinton in a meeting with Jarrett and the First Lady that he would not support her in the presidential primary ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "Catherine Emberton, 28, sold endangered tiger teeth and claws from the British Raj days . A jeweller who sold endangered tiger teeth and claws from the British Raj days on eBay has been spared jail. Catherine Emberton, 28, advertised hundreds of pieces from her home in Sheffield including cufflinks and a pendant from the 1880s, which were described as 'Victorian hunting trophies'. She pleaded guilty to three offences under the Control of Trade in Endangered Species (Enforcement) Regulations at Sheffield Crown Court. The silversmith, who traded on eBay under the name 'Gypsy Silver', was handed a 12-month community order and ordered her to carry out 120 hours of unpaid community work. Police and officers from the Wildlife Crime Unit raided her home last June and recovered tiger teeth,  claws and jewellery making materials. She advertised 129 items containing derivatives of tiger from November 2012 to June 2014 and during that time her business had a turnover of £17,360, the court heard. Emberton claimed the jewellery pre-dated 1947 regulations banning the sale of tiger derivatives as the items were classed as 'antique' because they were more than 50 years old. But scientific officers who examined photos of the jewellery said the items had not been significantly altered from their natural state and so were not exempt of the regulations. They said it was also impossible to tell purely by looking at the teeth or claws whether they were tiger or another creature and that could only be done by radio carbon dating. Prosecutor Richard Thyne said: 'She did not make reasonable inquiries as to the provenance of the items she was selling or make inquiries as to the law on the trade of endangered species.' Emberton accepted she had not made detailed inquiries to verify the origin of the pieces and 90 per cent were already in settings when she bought them, the vast majority from antique markets. She believed the items she sold were exempted from the regulations. Peter Pimm, for the defence highlighted the fact that she had only made a 'modest profit' out of her business. 'The last thing she wants to do is to make a profit from endangered species that is not her motive,' said Mr Pimm. She advertised hundreds of pieces of jewellery from her home in Sheffield dating back to the days of the British Raj in India . She sold cufflinks and a pendant from the 1880s, which were described as 'Victorian hunting trophies' 'The idea of trading in endangered species is complete anathema to her. You have got to rely on your wits, knowledge and experience and that's what she did. What she didn't do was read the guidance.' Judge Robert Moore ordered  the forfeiture and destruction of all the jewellery seized. He said: 'You are fundamentally a good person. This is not a case of fraudulent or dishonest selling of items derived from endangered species if it had been the sentence would have been immediate custody and substantial.' 'Anybody selling jewellery based on endangered species needs to check the precise law.' Speaking after  the hearing Emberton said: 'I feel the investigators should be going after the real villains and not people like me. 'They could stop people trading on eBay in endangered species derivatives tomorrow if the site complied.' Andy McWilliam, investigations officer for the National Wildlife Crime Unit said: 'Anybody who chooses to trade in endangered species has a duty to know the law. 'The illegal trade feeds the marketplace and is a threat to these species in the wild.' Police and officers from the Wildlife Crime Unit raided her home last June and recovered tiger teeth, claws and jewellery making materials .

{"question": "Louis van Gaal has been here before with the press questioning him, his players seemingly confused by his philosophy and the public bemused as the season tailspins into mediocrity. The only difference on the previous occasion was that Van Gaal tired of the challenge and gave up. It was 2008 and he was at AZ Alkmaar, an admittedly different proposition to Manchester United. But the ingredients were similar. The club was under-achieving, languishing in 11th place when they had been expected to challenge at the top of the table. And it seemed as if the players could not grasp what he was demanding from them. So Van Gaal walked out. He resigned from Alkmaar in March 2008. Louis van Gaal, pictured in training on Friday, takes Manchester United to face Liverpool at Anfield . Wayne Rooney celebrates scoring United's final goal in their 3-0 win against Tottenham last weekend . Van Gaal, pictured in 2007, resigned as manager of AZ Alkmaar only to return to the club and win the title . But then something remarkable occurred in the form of a players' mutiny. The team rebelled against Van Gaal's own decision to walk out leave them and demanded him back. Led by captain Stijn Schaars, central defender and vice-captain Kew Jaliens, midfielder David Mendes and Australian goalkeeper Joey Didulica the team leaders asked for a crisis meeting with the directors and the owner of the club. 'We felt insulted when the club told us Van Gaal was leaving,' said Kew Jaliens. 'The entire squad, felt that Van Gaal is the right man and the only man who could take this club and our squad to a higher level.' As United travel to Liverpool on Sunday with Champions League qualification hanging in the balance, the question is whether United's players and directors would do the same for Van Gaal today. Of course, thing aren't quite as bad as they were at AZ. After all, three defeats in 24 games would be satisfactory for most clubs. And last week's 3-0 win against Tottenham was a possibly the first sign that a new successful United team could emerge in the post-Ferguson era. Stijn Schaars, pictured during his days as an AZ Alkmaar player, did not want Van Gaal to leave the club . Antonio Valencia, Ander Herrera and Radamel Falcao (left to right) train ahead of their trip to Anfield . Indeed before Sunday's game at Anfield, Van Gaal was confident enough to talking about extending his time at Old Trafford beyond his current three-year deal. 'This will be my last job but there could be five years to go yet,' he said. 'I can extend my contract. You never know. I'm in a situation where I signed for three years because you can build something up in that time and the club agreed with that. I don't know how I would react in the circumstances when Manchester United ask me to extend, and if I should do that.' Perhaps their 3-0 win over Tottenham last weekend could be viewed as the United players own vote of confidence in their manager. Wayne Rooney later revealed that he had spoken to the team the night before and certainly it seemed as though they might have finally 'got' the elusive Van Gaal philosophy. And not before time: Sunday's clash with Liverpool could be defining for judging Van Gaal's first season a success or failure. Put baldy, finish fourth and Van Gaal can be broadly satisfied; finish fifth and he can expect to be questioned as to whether he is still among the top coaches in the world. It is crude and unsatisfactory measure of his first season – a point here or there might make the difference between fourth of fifth. Van Gaal has revealed the United job will be his last but he could extend his contract at Old Trafford . But Van Gaal needs to demonstrate that United are making progress and qualification for the Champions League is the only tangible way to do so. Last Sunday's victory was welcome, but was notable for being one of the few outstanding performances this season. The defeats at Swansea and to Arsenal in the FA Cup are still fresh in the mind. At times United's players seem to be inhibited by Van Gaal. Some at United believe he has been in danger of losing credibility among the players at times when he spoke about his 'philosophy', given the amount of times he has changed his formation. In addition, the players have seemed 'strangled' by Van Gaal at times, said one United source. His sheer intensity seems to overwhelm them. At Bayern Munich they would relate to that. They remember him there as coach brought back discipline to the squad and who introduced fresh intensity and a crisper, sharper passing game, a tactical prerequisite for a modern elite Champions League club. The Bayern players found their standards had to rise considerably to meet Van Gaal's expectations of passing accuracy and the foundations he laid have helped build the success of the club since he left. The Bayern Munich players felt they had to raise their standards considerably while Van Gaal was at the helm . But his discipline eventually was perceived as eccentric and bizarre, according to some at Bayern. The self-confidence, which helped underpin the team as they won the German League and Cup double in the first season and reached the Champions League final, became a liability as he sought to control more and more areas of the club. They still talk with wide-eyed astonishment about the day he dropped his trousers in team talk to demonstrate that he had the 'balls' to drop any of the star players. And they still raise their eyebrows at the manner in which Van Gaal organised meal times after training. Lunch time was a communal affair. And at Bayern, the whole team had to be assembled in matching kit before Van Gaal would give the signal for the meal to start. He once refused to allow the highly-respected club doctor, Hans Mueller-Wohlfahrt, who was then in his 60s, to join in lunch until he had gone back to change his socks. Mueller-Wohlfahrt was in his white club socks and the stipulated dress code was red socks. His obsession with order carries over on the pitch and his greatest strength for some and his biggest weakness for others. Johan Cruyff, his great football adversary, is one of those unimpressed with his need to control. Johan Cruyff says Van Gaal is a very good organiser but that's not the way he likes to do things . 'The difference is that he always organises a lot of things for people,' said Cruyff. 'I always use the basic quality of people to achieve what I want to achieve. That's a different way of thinking. I always love that they do things. And when it goes wrong, well, try to correct it in one way or another. His way is more as a very good organiser. That's the way he is' Of course, when he gets it right and a club or a group of players buy into what he has to offer, Van Gaal can be phenomenally successful as his time, at Ajax and his early days at Barcelona and Bayern demonstrate. And, of course, at AZ Alkmaar. That famous meeting, when the players begged him to stay at the Dutch club was a heated and emotional affair in which Van Gaal demanded the fill support and commitment of the players if he were to stay. The players agreed. The following season they won the Dutch league, the first time for 27 years that it had been won by a team other than PSV Eindhoven, Ajax or Feyenoord. If he can do the same for United next season, his genius will be confirmed. If they lose on Sunday and the club's trajectory doesn't change, he won't need to worry about what to do when he sitting down with the Glazers to extend his contract.

{"question": "'Devastating' head injuries: Austen Harrison, four, had been playing with a heavy fitting-room mirror . A four-year-old boy died from ‘devastating’ head injuries when an unstable shop mirror fell on him, an inquest heard today. Austen Harrison, of Turners Hill, West Sussex, was playing with a heavy fitting-room mirror while his father tried on a suit at a Hugo Boss shop when it toppled over and crushed him. He underwent an emergency operation to relieve pressure on his brain following the incident in Oxfordshire, but died four days later in hospital after life-support was switched off. An inquest into his death at Oxford Coroner's Court heard that the mirror was not fixed to the wall and that its free-standing position meant it could easily overbalance. Austen was with his parents, Simon and Irina Harrison, when the incident happened at the Bicester outlet village at around 8.30pm on June 4, 2013. Mrs Harrison and her son met Mr Harrison after he finished work and had dinner at a Carluccio's restaurant before going to the Hugo Boss store. In evidence read to the jury of seven men and two women by Darren Salter, the senior coroner for Oxfordshire, Mr Harrison said the shop was not busy when they arrived and that he tried on a number of suits and jackets while his wife and son wandered around. As he tried on various suits Austen came in to the changing area and began looking at himself in a large mirror and playing with its large winged sections, attached to the main mirror with hinges. Mr Harrison, a mechanical aerospace engineering consultant, said he moved the mirror's wings himself as he looked at a suit, moving them out to an angle of about 45 degrees. Accident scene: An inquest at Oxford Coroner's Court heard that the mirror was not fixed to the wall of the Hugo Boss store in Bicester (above) and that its free-standing position meant it could easily overbalance . Giving evidence: Simon Harrison (left, today), the boy's father, said the shop was not busy when they arrived and that he tried on a number of suits and jackets. Pictured (right) is a closed sign following the incident . He said: ‘I didn't have any concerns because I assumed they would be fixed to the wall. I couldn't think of any reason why such a large mirror wouldn't be fixed to the wall.’ But as he tried on another suit and walked to his wife to try on a tie, they heard an extremely loud bang, ‘as if something had fallen over’, and someone gasp. He said: ‘I instantly knew Austen was lying underneath it, as it was not lying flat on the floor.’ Mr Harrison went straight over and lifted the mirror from his son, who was lying motionless. He said: ‘He was lying face up with his legs straight out and his arms by his side.’ Treatment: Austen was taken to John Radcliffe Hospital (pictured) in Oxford, where he underwent emergency surgery for swelling to his brain . Mr Harrison carried his son into the main part of the shop, where an off-duty doctor assisted, but after he was taken to John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford he underwent emergency surgery for swelling to his brain. Doctors told the family Austen would not recover from the ‘irreversible’ brain damage. Life support was switched off and he died at 5.45am on June 8. In his statement, Mr Harrison told the inquest that while his son was in hospital he went back to the shop and told managers he was in a critical condition. Mr Harrison said he asked the manager if he had viewed the CCTV footage, and was told it showed Austen pulling the mirror off the wall. The inquest continues.

{"question": "For much of the past four years, James Forrest has been damaged, both physically and mentally. Ronny Deila, the Celtic manager, describes him as a 'frightened' footballer. Self-belief was never an issue until a relentless series of muscle injuries began. To some, Forrest is the best player Celtic have. An £8million star-in-waiting. Reduced to the role of a walk-on extra in each of the past four seasons, however, it’s hard to be certain. ‘It’s been a long time since James Forrest has been consistently good,’ said Deila. ‘But, touch wood, that’s six months without a pulled muscle and he is moving in the right direction. Celtic winger James Forrest has been plagued by injuries during the last four years of his career . ‘We have been unbelievably patient with him because we have had to build him up from the bottom.’ Deila might have been describing ’70s TV character Steve Austin, The Six Million Dollar Man, rather than a winger recently rated in an altogether higher bracket. Stripped down and carefully rebuilt in a painstaking quest to get to the heart of the injuries that have rendered him a Parkhead bystander at times, there is cautious optimism from Deila that — this time — Forrest might just be ready. A second-half substitute and the scorer of the second goal against Dundee United, the winger was close to stealing the show in Sunday’s League Cup Final win. Yet his efforts were not appreciated by everyone. John Guidetti’s feelings on the spot-kick Forrest won and missed were embarrassingly public. Knocking the desk before him, however, Deila welcomed signs that the physical frailties in the Forrest make-up are healing. Forrest missed a penalty in the League Cup final after arguing with John Guidetti over who should take it . ‘It has been hard work building his self-belief back up, so that he won’t get these injuries,’ said the Celtic boss. ‘It has been slow. I was happy for him to score on Sunday and win a penalty. ‘But, you know, he is not even close to what he can be as a footballer. ‘I am happy he is going in the right direction — but we know there are still things to work on. ‘He has the right people around him and we know that, if we get it right, he will be a very important player for us.’ Arriving from Stromsgodset, Deila expected Forrest to be one of his key players. A coach who revels in the relentless quest for physical improvement, the Scotland international has become his pet project. According to Deila, the balance of his body was all wrong, his running style placing strain on vulnerable muscles. Celtic manager Ronny Deila says he has had to be patient with Forrest while he overcomes his injury hell . ‘James has been worse than he is now,’ he said. ‘He was afraid because he had been out for two of the past four years with a lot of pulled muscles. ‘You get frightened and we need to get his confidence back and believing in himself. It has been psychological, but it has also about getting the balance and control of his body. ‘He has a great attitude and is working hard. So far, we have managed to get him out of the cycle of pulled muscles — but he has had other things, as well. ‘When you get a sore knee or twisted ankle, it affects your way of running. ‘He’s in a very good place now after 30 minutes on Sunday and 90 minutes last week, plus full training on Monday and Tuesday.’ Forrest is available for selection against Dundee United in their Scottish Cup quarter-final replay. ‘I can see he will get better and better,’ said Deila, who can call again on Adam Matthews at right-back. ‘It’s about strengthening his core, getting balance to change direction at high speeds. The medical staff have been working hard at getting it right, but now he needs more time on the pitch. Forrest smashes the ground in frustration after failing to score the rebound to his missed penalty . ‘His body is not nearly where it should be. It takes him five days to recover from playing 90 minutes. ‘We have to be careful because, when you are tired, that’s when you get pulled muscles. ‘We have to build him up step by step. Hopefully, in six months we will be sitting feeling excited about James Forrest.’ His inclusion in Gordon Strachan’s Scotland squad to face Northern Ireland and Gibraltar surprised some as much as did the exclusion of Forrest’s new Parkhead team-mates Gary Mackay-Steven and Stuart Armstrong. ‘I am not surprised about Scotland because they are thinking the same as us,’ said Deila. ‘They know what he is able to do and his skills are so high in certain situations, like when we want pace and touch, ability in one-on-ones. Gordon will be thinking about Gibraltar and he needs players who can go past defenders. ‘Stuart and Gary have just started at Celtic and I think they need more consistency and performances. In the end, hopefully, they will be good enough to get into the squad.’ The 23-year-old did get his name on the score sheet however as Celtic beat Dundee United 2-0 . After already playing for United in the Scottish Cup, neither can face their former club on Wednesday evening. Familiarity is in danger of breeding contempt between the teams and others must wish they could also excuse themselves from a third meeting in 10 days. The three games have featured four red cards (two rescinded) and three penalty kicks. United’s keeper Rado Cierzniak has saved two of them. To that end, Leigh Griffiths and Kris Commons will again be assigned spot-kick duties for Celtic. Guidetti, who had a spectacular public strop after Forrest held firm on Sunday, will again be told to stand aside. ‘I have not said so much,’ remarked Deila of that episode. ‘We have talked about it, but it’s nothing. ‘We had Leigh and Kris to take penalties and both were off. ‘I don’t have any problems with John as a character. He is a funny boy. He is a striker who loves scoring goals and wants to take penalties. ‘They are young players and they have to learn and use these experiences to get better. ‘We talked about the need to put the team first. There’s no point arguing inside the team.’", "answer": ["James Forrest has been cursed with injuries throughout the last four years .\nForrest scored the second in the League Cup win against Dundee United .\nRonny Deila says the Celtic winger has been frightened of another injury .\nForrest has now gone six months without pulling a muscle however .\nDeila hopes the 23-year-old is over the worst of his injury hell ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "Jackie McNamara last night backed the decision to let Virgil van Dijk play in Sunday’s League Cup final – but took a swipe at Celtic’s willingness to question the disciplinary system while matters were still pending. Van Dijk will face United at Hampden after his red card was quashed – with Calum Butcher, the man the Dutch defender tangled with on the Tannadice turf – already cleared to play due to being the beneficiary of mistaken identity by linesman Graham Chambers. But while the United boss welcomed the fact that - with the exception of Nadir Ciftci - neither of the two finalists will be hindered by suspensions, he believes Celtic’s readiness to question the loophole that got Butcher off the hook was inappropriate. Virgil van Dijk was sent off in the first half of the Scottish Cup draw with Dundee United . ‘If you ask me, I would prefer that all the guys were playing – Nadir as well even though he picked up two yellows,’ McNamara said. ‘You want all of your best players to be playing in Cup Finals - you don’t want anyone to miss out. ‘I can understand the decisions. The two of them – Butcher and van Dijk were in a melee at that point but due to the loophole or rules, whether it’s right or wrong, that’s just the way it is. ‘I don’t think the whole thing is right. But again, it’s outwith my control. The Celtic defender went in hard on opposing player Callum Butcher at Tannadice . ‘From our point of view, we have kept our silence and our focus on Sunday. ‘We haven’t mentioned anything about wanting anyone suspended or that this guy has done this or that. ‘We’re focused on our own team. The last thing I would want is for any of my players to speak out about the opposition and what-not when it’s been dealt with by the authorities. I’m pleased that they haven’t.’ The fall-out from the Scottish Cup quarter-final at Tannadice has threatened to overshadow the build-up to the first showpiece occasion of the season. McNamara, for one, feels the myriad issues to come out of the spicy 1-1 draw on Tayside last weekend point towards the imminent introduction of video evidence. ‘I don’t think it would be a bad thing in certain instances. There’s got to be a real call for it,’ he added. ‘On Sunday, with the time it took them to make a decision, I think it would have been helpful. ‘But again, it’s affordability. Where do you draw the line in terms of games that are and aren’t on television? ‘The game has changed so much with the appeal system and tribunals. Video evidence … it seems to be going that way.’ Dundee United players appeal to the linesman after the clash in the Scottish Cup . Dundee United lost the Scottish Cup final to St Johnstone at the end of McNamara’s first season in charge. Rank outsiders to upset Ronny Deila’s Treble-seeking side this weekend, the former Celtic star believes it’s imperative that his side maintain their discipline if they are to stand a chance of lifting the League Cup trophy. ‘I think that’s key to it,’ he continued. ‘It’s Celtic again, but you play most teams four times a season anyway and you get to know everybody really well throughout the campaign. ‘It shouldn’t come into play at all what happened last Sunday. I’ll make sure that the players understand the importance of discipline. We have to be committed, we have to compete, but first and foremost we have got to make sure we keep our cool.’ The second of four back-to-back games between the clubs this month spanning the three domestic competitions, McNamara believes that Celtic’s superior depth in squad is another factor in Deila’s favour this Sunday. The Dutch defender will be able to play in the Scottish League Cup final after having his red card rescinded . ‘You could argue that (it’s easier for them) as they have the biggest squad in the league,’ he added. ‘But that’s not changed from the start of the season. We just have to make sure everybody is ready. In certain games I have moved players around, I have maybe made five or six changes in a game as I need everybody ready. Not just for one game, but for a full season. Sometimes it’s not worked and sometimes it has.’ McNamara had revealed how he has changed his squad’s routine this week, consciously making it a different experience to the build-up to last season’s Scottish Cup final. Last year, the Tannadice squad were holed up in a plush St Andrews hotel for four nights whereas this week they have spent just one night there – with another overnight stay to come outside Edinburgh on Saturday. ‘We only went for one night this year – cost cutting!’ said McNamara with a smile. ‘The media day was our day for the players so we just decided to stay up after training and just settle them down. We wanted to make sure they were all relaxed and ready for Sunday. ‘There are certain things that we need to work on that I feel will help us if we want to win the match.’ United striker Nadir Ciftci (centre left) was also cleared for kicking Scott Brown (centre right) in the head . Asked if, with the benefit of hindsight, he regretted some aspects of last year’ s preparations for the Scottish Cup final, McNamara replied: ‘No because that’s what I did at the time. ‘I don’t look at anything like that, what-ifs. I’m a great believer that things happen for a reason. I’m just delighted that, within a year, we find ourselves in another cup final. ‘That says a lot about what we have at our club, what we have in the dressing room, the mentality that we’re trying to instil into them. It’s something that Celtic have, the belief that they can go and do it. ‘The games that we’ve struggled in this season have been when we haven’t handled the expectation. Against Celtic and Aberdeen, however, we have held our own. We’ve lost one, we’ ve won one with both teams. In other games, where we have been expected to win, we’ve fallen by the wayside. ‘That’s something we are building on. We’re getting closer, but we are still way apart on the consistency side of it. Last year, we won 16 league games. This year, we have won 14 already. So we’re getting there.’", "answer": ["Celtic drew 1-1 with Dundee United in Scottish Cup on Sunday .\nVirgil van Dijk was sent off after challenge on Callum Butcher .\nDutch defender has red card rescinded and can play in League Cup final .\nVan Dijk can now line up against Dundee United at Hampden Park ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "Those who would love to see the lesser spotted Laura Robson back competing on a tennis court are learning that it is a question of hope trumping expectation. Having withdrawn from the qualifying event of this week’s Miami Open, she has now removed herself from the entry list to next month’s WTA Tour event in Bogota, and the new target for her return appears to be the French Open in May. That suggests she is going to be left with at least 16 months of catching up to do when her troublesome wrist is deemed fit for full tournament play again, having not played since the Australian Open in January last year. Former British No 1 Laura Robson protects her wrist while out in London . Nobody is more frustrated about this than Robson herself, now 21 and without a world ranking. She would dearly love to be in Miami now, but instead is back practising over in Bradenton near Tampa at the IMG Academy. Perhaps encouragingly, she posted a picture of herself on Twitter doing a full, tendon-testing handstand. Robson admitted last summer that she has shed tears over this hiatus in her career, which has proved longer than feared since she played her last match in Melbourne before eventually undergoing wrist surgery. Here this week her manager, Max Eisenbud, issued a positive-sounding update while preaching patience: “I’m happy with the way it’s been going and she’s been hitting the ball great in practice,” he said. “ It’s a question of waiting until the coaches think she can play five matches in a week. It’s all about when she is ready to compete. We don’t want to put her in a situation where she can’t play a full tournament.” Among Eisenbud’s other clients include Maria Sharapova, whose intermittent struggles with her shoulder have informed his approach. “I learned a lot from the whole experience with Maria, and that’s why I feel strongly about not rushing it. Laura is still young with a lot of time ahead.” Sharapova seems to have won her battle, but there are other examples of players who show just what a tough road lies ahead for Robson - and that on the assumption that she shows a full-on appetite for hard work that has not always been evident. When she finally decided to go for surgery last April to repair a minor tendon tear she sought the advice of 2009 US Open champion Juan Martin Del Potro, who has had operations on both wrists. She used the same specialist at the Mayo clinic in Minnesota. Ironically this has turned out to be the Argentine’s own comeback event and on Thursday evening he lost 6-4 7-6 to Vasek Pospisil. The fact that this was just his second tournament in fourteen months after an abortive return in January shows just how infernally complex wrist injuries are for tennis players. He was just delighted to be back on court: “It's not 100% free, but I felt even better than Sydney tournament in January,” he said. “ It's only two months after my second surgery and my left wrist. I feel better week by week, but it's still very early to feel 100%. “Mentally you must be strongest enough to deal with the problem and get up every morning to do your treatments and rehab and stay calm, looking forward for the future. I'm not hurried to be in the top 10 very soon. I want to play tennis. It doesn't matter how long it's take me to be in the top again.” Being absent for a long period of time with any injury brings with it problems in a tennis world that constantly evolves. An example of this is 2010 Wimbledon finalist Vera Zvonareva, who was out for 17 months following the 2012 Olympics due to a shoulder problem that required surgery. Robson has sought the advice of 2009 US Open champion Juan Martin Del Potro . Del Potro made only his second tournament appearance in 14 months at the Miami Open . Since returning at the start of last year the talented Russian has not got past the third round at any event and her ranking still languishes at 153. She lost another first round here this week. So it could be hard for Robson whenever she returns, although on her side is that she does have bags of natural ability and is a superb ball striker. That much was clear when, enjoying a rare spell free from injury, she became the first British player since Jo Durie to reach the world’s top 30 in the summer of 2013 aged only 19. It might yet make more sense for her to wait until the season begins on more forgiving grass rather than arduous clay to make her return. When she does she will have a new clothes sponsor in Nike after being dropped by adidas, and will be coached by Colombian Mauricio Hadad, a former guide of Heather Watson.

{"question": "Food hygiene is so poor in more than 500 hospitals, care homes and nurseries that they have been ordered to take action to improve. More than 250 kitchens require major or urgent improvement after being rated one-star or lower, the standard of hygiene usually associated with the worst kebab vans. It raises fears that patients, children and the elderly risk illness from meals served by public service kitchens and sparks calls for urgent action to address the problem. More than 250 kitchens require major or urgent improvement after being rated one-star or lower, the standard of hygiene usually associated with the worst kebab vans . Under the Food Hygiene Rating Scheme, establishments preparing and serving food are given a star rating for hygiene. Public health minister Jane Ellison said it 'provides transparency to consumers on hygiene standards in places where they eat or buy food'. The best rated sites are given five stars and a named 'very good'. Four stars awarded for 'good' levels of hygiene, and three stars for being 'generally satisfactory'. However, two stars mean improvement is required, one star means 'major improvement required' and zero stars suggests 'urgent action required'. According to figures released in Parliament, more than 500 hospitals, childcare and caring premises have been given two or fewer stars. The Food Standards Agency says its ratings scheme 'will help you choose where to eat out or shop for food' It includes 242 given two stars, 255 one star and six given no stars at all. A further 1,467 are only 'generally satisfactory'. The ratings are awarded by council inspectors. Luciana Berger, Labour's shadow public health minister, said: 'It is not acceptable that over 500 hospitals, childcare and caring premises have been told to improve their food hygiene. 'Everyone using these public services should have the right to expect food that has been prepared safely, in a clean environment. 'The Government must hold these premises to account on the urgent action they must now take to address these serious failings in standards.' Lciana Berger, Labour's shadow public health minister, said was 'not acceptable' that over 500 hospitals, childcare and caring premises have been told to improve their food hygiene . The Food Standards Agency says its ratings scheme 'will help you choose where to eat out or shop for food by giving you information about the hygiene standards in restaurants, pubs, cafes, takeaways, hotels, and other places you eat out'. But people admitted to hospital will not have the same degree of choice, and most will be forced to eat the meals served or rely on friends and family to boy food from outside. A Department of Health spokesman said: 'These figures show 98.6 per cent of kitchens in hospitals and care facilities are performing well – the second highest number of all industries in the UK. However there are a small number that need to improve and we expect local services to take strong action on this.' At the inspection, the officer will check: . * how hygienically the food is handled – how it is prepared, cooked, re-heated, cooled and stored . * the condition of the structure of the buildings – the cleanliness, layout, lighting, ventilation and other facilities . * how the business manages what it does to make sure food is safe and so that the officer can be confident standards will be maintained in the future . The hygiene standards found at the time of inspection are then rated on a scale. At the bottom of the scale is '0' – this means urgent improvement is required.

{"question": "(CNN)When Selena was breaking concert attendance records at home and abroad, there weren't a lot of crossover pop stars who looked like her in the United States. There was Rita Moreno and Gloria Estefan and ... well, that's about it. The March 31, 1995, death of the Mexican-American singer plunged many Latino listeners into mourning and brought her music to the attention of English speakers who would soon become fans. Selena Quintanilla-Perez started singing the Tejano music that eventually made her famous in her father's restaurant in Lake Jackson, Texas. Her father Abraham taught the family band and named them Los Dinos after his own group from earlier years. Selena's brother, A.B., played bass, and her sister, Suzette, played drums. When the family moved to Corpus Christi, the group started getting gigs at local parties and weddings. Selena was only 15 when she won female entertainer of the year at the Tejano Music Awards. That got her a record contract, and several albums followed. She eventually married her guitarist, Chris Perez. In 1994, she won a Grammy for best Mexican-American album for \"Selena Live!\" and seemed poised for mainstream stardom. When the president of Selena's fan club shot her to death the following year in a Texas motel room, her first English-language album was months from release. Her death made international headlines. She was 23 years old. Twenty years later, her influence is still being felt. Her official Facebook page still has more than 2 million likes, and fans are remembering the singer who crossed barriers and made them sing and dance to her blend of Tejano music. Fans will celebrate her life and legacy at the commemorative Fiesta de la Flor in Corpus Christi in mid-April. Here are five things you may not know about Selena. Selena had to learn Spanish. A third-generation Texan of Mexican descent, Selena didn't grow up speaking Spanish. Neither did her husband, Perez, who played guitar in her band and fell in love with her on the road. In his book, \"To Selena, with Love,\" Perez said they practiced speaking Spanish before their first big publicity blitz in Mexico. \"In Mexico, Selena mangled her conversations in Spanish like the rest of us, but not for long.\" \"She said, 'It'll be cool. You watch. I'm going to learn Spanish and surprise everybody,' \" Perez wrote. \"She got better and better, to the point where I'd have to ask her to slow down so that I could understand what she was saying.\" She sold out the Astrodome. Selena performed several times at the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo at the Astrodome to sold-out crowds of more than 60,000 people. (It wasn't just any rodeo: Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson and the Osmonds have all played the event.) \"We had 20 performances this year,\" Leroy Shafer, assistant general manager of the show, told the New York Times in 1995. \"We had Reba McEntire, George Strait, Clint Black and Vince Gill. She had the highest-selling show concert at our show this year, at 61,041 in the Astrodome.\" Her album went to No. 1. Her 1995 crossover album, \"Dreaming of You,\" went to the top of the Billboard 200 the first week it was released. She was the first Latin artist to debut atop the list. \"There were supposed to be 14 tracks, but we had only recorded four of them, so we put together a tribute album of new and old songs,\" Nancy Brennan, then vice president of A&R at EMI, told Texas Monthly. \"Making that album was the most difficult thing I have ever had to do, because we were listening to her voice all day and crying as we were mixing the songs.\" \"Selena\" (the movie) ignited Jennifer Lopez's career. Starring as Selena in the 1997 movie of the same name, Jennifer Lopez became the first Latina actress to be paid $1 million for a movie role. Lopez was nominated for a Golden Globe for her performance. \"Getting to play the part of Selena was life-changing for me,\" Lopez told Para Todos magazine. \"I got to immerse myself in her life, got to know her family, her home, her culture ... every part of her story. It was a special time in my life both professionally and personally. Playing her not only opened doors for me in the film world, but it inspired me to start my own music career. In a lot of ways, I wouldn't be where I am today if I hadn't had that experience.\" Selena's killer is eligible for parole in 2025. Yolanda Saldivar, the president of Selena's fan club, was sentenced to life in prison in October 1995 for Selena's murder. Saldivar must serve at least 30 years of her sentence before she is eligible for parole. Selena was meeting with Saldivar at a Corpus Christi motel to discuss her concerns that Saldivar had embezzled money from her when Saldivar shot her, according to trial testimony. Saldivar argued that she accidentally fired the shot, but the jury didn't buy it.

{"question": "THE MIDWIFE’S SISTER . by Christine Lee . (Pan £7.99) Within the very sentimental world of Sunday night television, Call The Midwife’s heroine, Jenny Lee, was played with gentle reserve by actress Jessica Raine. Call The Midwife’s heroine, Jenny Lee (left), is based on a real person . But a startling new memoir by the sister of the midwife on whom the character is based suggests the real Jenny Lee was a more fiery and difficult character. The young Jenny actually came to midwifery after being dismissed from her nursing course at the Royal Berkshire Hospital for losing her temper and smacking a small child. Then only months away from qualifying, the consultants pinned her near-perfect exam papers up on the notice board as an example to others. But she was deeply in love with a much older married man at the time, and Christine Lee now believes that her sister’s romantic frustrations were the cause of her angry outbursts. Reading the details of the sisters’ childhood, it’s obvious that Jenny had cause for anger long before her married lover refused to leave his wife. Jennifer was born in 1936, the daughter of a Post Office clerk called Elsie — a woman with ‘bedroom eyes, fabulous hour-glass figure and great legs’ — and a handsome chancer, Gordon Lee, who had whisked Elsie away on his milk float from the dance at which they met. Christine came along in 1939 as Gordon built up a successful haulage business. The first seven years of Christine’s life were idyllic — she had parents who laughed and holiday adventures on the Essex coast with her fearless older sister. Their mother flirted her way to extra luxuries during rationing. But everything changed one summer day in 1945, when Elsie came home to find her husband in bed with his secretary, Judith. Elsie had a stroke. Divorce followed. The girls were sent to a convent school run by nuns whose metal rulers left savage, red weals on dyslexic Christine’s hands as she struggled to write. Jennifer kicked back at her tormentors and got the pair expelled. Meanwhile, Gordon married Judith and the wealthy couple moved to a luxurious country home — except for the room set aside for his two girls. That boasted bare boards, a bare lightbulb and one camp bed. The real Jenny Lee (played in the BBC series by Jessica Raine, second right) ended up in midwifery after being dismissed from her nursing course at the Royal Berkshire Hospital for losing her temper . Elsie went on to marry a violent bully called Jock, who demanded the girls be out of his sight when he came home from work at 5pm. By this point, Christine claims, Jennifer had become quite violent, sometimes ‘grabbing me by the hair and repeatedly banging my head against the wall’. On one occasion, her older sister chased her around the house with a carving knife. Christine had done nothing to provoke the attacks — ‘her fury was all to do with the collapse of home life’. That collapse became total when 14-year-old Jennifer accidentally stayed downstairs playing the piano after the 5 pm curfew. Jock slammed the piano lid onto her fingers and she was thrown out of the house the next morning. A year later, she lied about her age and got a job as secretary to a headmaster her mother would come to call ‘Neville the Devil’. Jennifer fell in love with him and there was a local scandal. He was the one who eventually insisted she move away to begin a career in nursing. Jennifer adored the profession, but while her sister studied, Christine preferred to party. Marriage to an ambitious doctor seemed an easy way out, but when she needed spinal surgery shortly after the birth of her first daughter, she realised her husband was straying. She would go on to marry four times and have two more children, while Jennifer settled for a marriage with good friend Phillip Worth and had two daughters. Neville remained the love of her life. Both girls moved into the arts after having their children. While Jennifer built a career as a concert pianist then a writer, Christine became a sculptor. But they grew apart. Christine married into money, which Jennifer resented. And Jennifer’s experience working with the nuns of Poplar led her to become religious in a way that alienated her from Christine, who felt shut out by her sister’s reliable response of ‘Go with God’ to any dilemma. Christine felt she used it to justify a lack of engagement with other people’s problems. But Christine says she found peace with her ‘fierce, no-nonsense, brisk and kind’ sister at the end. Beneath the large ‘DO NOT RESUSCITATE’ notice pinned over the bed in which she died from cancer in 2011, Jennifer finally relaxed and talked openly with Christine for the first time in decades. The following year, Christine celebrated their enduring bond in an 8 ft sculpture for Exeter Cathedral — two angels, strong and loving, with a narrow but unbreachable space between them.", "answer": ["Jenny Lee's life was turned upside down when her parents divorced .\nShe became violent after her mother married a bully called Jock .\nShe turned to midwifery after being dismissed from a nursing course .\nJenny later moved into the creative and became a concert pianist ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "It has been illegal to drink alcohol on the Tube in London for seven years, but there is now a new way to enjoy cocktails on your commute. A new bar opens today in an old abandoned air raid shelter from World War Two and it has been designed to resemble a vintage Underground station. Based in Carnaby Street, Cahoots, will transport guests back to the 1940s, in a bid to bring Soho’s illicit and nocturnal escapades from the era back to life. Scroll down for video . Enjoy being able to drink on the tube! Cahoot is a 1940s themed bar opening in Soho, and transports guests back to the period, with an old tube carriage for seating, sandbags and classic cocktails . Club owners Charlie Gilkes and Duncan Stirling tried to keep the bar as authentic to how the underground would have been in the 1940s, complete with the a wooden staircase entrance in homage to the old wooden escalators . From quirky cocktails served in clocks, to the authentic vintage signs, the centrally-located bar is the brainchild of Charlie Gilkes, 30, and Duncan Stirling, 33. The pair are owners of the Bunga Bunga bar and Maggie’s nightclub, which is inspired by Margaret Thatcher and thought that as the Soho venue was used in the war as an air raid shelter, it would prove to be a poignant spot to host the bar. Charlie Gilkes of Inception Group said: 'We decided to open Cahoots, after having been inspired by true events that occurred in post-war Britain, and the venue's own extraordinary heritage. 'The site was formerly Tatty Bogle, an out-of-hours drinking club, first opened in 1917 by a group of Scottish officers. 'It was also used as a bomb shelter during World War II and the wartime membership book contains names such as Burgess, Maclean, Anthony Blunt and Buster Crabbe. With Cahoots we loved the idea of bringing the history of the place back to our visitors.' First timers are greeted by the station master, in character, at the entry kiosk and issued a ‘day ticket’ to enter the underground station . During the war a number of disused underground stations were used for shelter and inhabitants would bring their own nick-nicks and furnishings to feel at home during the raids. To bring Cahoots to life, the pair recreated the vintage tube carriage using real London Underground fabrics, and leather from the period. They also aimed to make the entrance as authentic as possible to the wooden escalators that would have been used in the stations. If the decor is not enough to inspire a visit, the extensive cocktail menu is an impressive eight pages long and vast amount on offer are priced £7-£9. Chose to indulge in Dig for Victory-style cocktails, drinks served in Thermos flasks, milk bottles, as well as new variations of old favourites. Alternatively the impressive Cahoots signature cocktail is the Tanqueray No.TEN Station Clock, which has a working face, and serves eight for £150. Bottoms up! You are spoilt for choice at Cahoots with eight pages of cocktails including the Give Peas a Chance (£10).  Inspired by gimlets, it is made from  Goose Original vodka, garden peas, lime juice, basil, agave syrup, and a Moët & Chandon Brut Impérial NV champagne foam . When you arrive at the Soho location, you are greeted by staff who issue you with a ticket to board the underground tube carriage . Even the staff are dressed in character, with 1946 outfits, accents, nicknames with back stories as to how they came to work in the bar. Another interesting feature about the bar is the dimly-lit cosy air raid bunker seating booth, which is perfect for dates due to the snug proximity. The surroundings will be brought to life by 1940s- style singer and musicians, with possible cabaret events being put on in the near future. Cahoots is opening today in Kingly Court, W1, opens on Thursday 5 March, with free entry, and opportunities to reserve tables via the website. As well as serving classic cocktails, black market liquor and post-war favourites are also available, in particular rum and gin based drinks are furtively knocked back from old mugs, hip flasks, vintage milk bottles and tins . Those in groups are able to pass time with the Cahoots signature sharer cocktail, ‘The Tanqueray No. TEN Station Clock’, served in an actual clock with a working clock face . The cocktail list features Dig-for-victory drinks, which fit perfectly in with 1940s theme of the bar, which includes bunting, sandbags and fabric used for old underground tubes . Cahoots is located on the former site of Tatty Bogle, an out-of-hours drinking club, first opened in 1917 by a group of Scottish officers. It was used as a bomb shelter during World War II . During the war, several disused underground stations were turned into air raid shelters and Londoners would transform the spaces into a ‘home away from home’, with their own nick-nacks and furnishings . The 1940s-style drinks are served in Thermos flasks, milk bottles, and to do a modern twist on classic favourites .", "answer": ["Soho-based Cahoots aims to transport guests back to the war period, with themed cocktails and authentic decor .\nAmong the delights are a cocktail drank out of a clock, staff in character, and ticket booth upon your entrance .\nThe vintage tube seating area was created using old underground carriage fabrics ."], "label": "SUM"}
